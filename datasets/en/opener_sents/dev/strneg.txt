The drive to the ground was a lengthy 2 hours each morning as the roads are very gridlocked .
I am very upset about this hotel !
Very bad hotel
Never again !
Really gross
The bed , especially the mattress were unconfortable !
Piped music was so loud it made your ears sting !
Not a comfortable hotel at all .
