But the whole experience was nice and worth it .
All comfort Resort
The bungalow was excellent , the pool guys always helped and were very pleasant .
That was a surprise .
The service is really top of the line , and rooms are renovated in a very classy , but modern style .
We had a groundfloor room so access for my scootmobile was no problem and parking of the scootmobile was also sorted without any fuss · a great team , staff and management .
Overall , I liked the rest .
Great location not far from the city centers and we never needed any bus ride during our stay .
The atmosphere is delightfully tranquil and relaxing and it was for us a lovely place to return to after a busy day sightseeing in the City .
We liked the generous variety of food at the different restaurants .
The room was ideal for a romantic stay : large comfortable bed , separate furnished dressing · room and well · equipped bathroom .
It is located 7 minutes away by foot from Amsterdam cetral train terminal .

Advantages of this hostal · it is cheap and located in the center .
Staff were friendly and helpful .
Food was always hot too .
Perfect hotel to discover Köln , just out of the real center ( only 2 stops with the " U · Bahn " ) .
The employees know most of world main languages English German Russian arabic etc. the last thing that I would like to say is you can find all kinds of food from different regions of the world .
Beautifull gardens and swimmingpools !
Okay for a business trip .
The Location is excellent within walking distance to Tivoli and the city center in general , plus being such a huge building you could easily spot it from a distance and never get lost .
· bathroom small , but clean
Very attentive and courtesious staff , but I would suggest the management a more careful selection of suppliers of desert trips .
The pool , jacuzzi and sauna were very clean and relaxing .
There are many things to do ( water sports , mountain excursions etc ) .
Kind and friendly employes at the reception , supermarket and bar .
I can 't really complain about anything .

If you are looking at the " budget " hotel and you don 't care much about the room size and the available facilities , then this hotel might be an option for you .
There is a lot of bars and a la carte restaurants.We could easily make reservation for a la carte restaurants and we mostly liked to have a dinner in ottoman restaurant .
