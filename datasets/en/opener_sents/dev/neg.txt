But from the hotel to the airport there are some strict rules at this hotel .
Too pollution in the surrounding streets .
Our room was a city view room facing Street .. So from a view perspective , there is nothing that we can wow about !!!
Food prices though are completely out of touch with Sofia reality , even in comparison with other similar hotels in the city .
Avoid .
Cannot get any assistance with issues
The salesmen could take a no and they were kinda rude .
Anyway , think before making booking of this hotel .
i couldn 't go back 2 this hotel because i had hardly eaten all holiday
Crowded , noisy , smelly , unfriendly .
Breakfast very mediocre , bread too hard , scrambled eggs with melk .
Rooms are noisy , e.g. when somebody is taking a shower , u will hear the plumbing cooling off for the next hour .. a loud ticking noise .
The check in took quite a bit of time , as the guest before me had some questions and they didn 't have a second person .
Condition of the room is very poor and also it was not cleaned properly .
Otherwise , I would stay somewhere else .
The bath is sort of even tinier .
I have experienced in Linen change in the bath room of Villa which i staid , since the linen are not fresh on my entry to the room .
Now back , no one will reply to emails and they do not answer phones
The decor of the hotel is very old just another 3 star hotel standard !!!
finally we had to pay 20 Euro for internet for a week · that should be included .
You guessed right , a big dirty spot on sheet .
Old and very tired hotel
Complaints handling took hours .
There is nothing but highway close to hotel .
No ironing board and iron in room , small table top board and non · steam iron is supplied when requested , but to be honest are useless for removing creases in cotton shirts .
You need to count 20 · 30 minutes walking time to get to Dubling city center from this hotel .
Hotel is very over · priced considering that you get dated rooms with old and hard linen , towels etc. , poor selection and quality of food at breakfast and many parts of the hotel were closed or under refurbishment , rude and unfriendly staff ruined our stay and the hotel boasts about its art collection when it should pay more attention to customer service and standards for guests
In this day and age to charge Euro 20.00 for Wi · Fi a day is silly · low band should be free in your room .
It was all overcooked and luke warm !
The only downside was too few business centers and one was closed .
Not suitable for couples without children as evening entertainment was almost nill and geared for families .
My wife and I stayed at the Waterfront Hotel , in Gzira , Sliema , Malta but we will not go back .
Fruit choice is not large .
we were completely dissatisfied with the owners ' unfriendly attitude , the room was a lot different from its foto in the hotel 's internet site and the room was smelling as bad as being in a hospital ...
Extremely unpleasant odor in the bathroom , Very poor breakfast and almost expired date of the food ( butter , baguette ) .
When we stayed there , there was a weird smell around the sitting area .
The hotel itself looks a bit dated , reminding of the grand style of famous hotels in other world cities .
For me , this experience is worse than any hostel before .
Too expensive for ordinary service
Wasn 't that easy to move around .
