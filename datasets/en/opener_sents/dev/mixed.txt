The good sides are limited to two : The location is excellent , and the breakfast was OK .
animation team super only old equipment
I remeber we booked the hotel mainly because of it ´ s central location and the price , but definately wouldn ´ t repeat my stay in there .
Fitness room lacks equipment for basic weight training but offers state of the art cardio equipment .
Staff is not the most positive persons in the world but still helpful and understanding if you need something .
Bathroom was clean , however gets flooded when showering , with more people in one room very wet !
The staff is friendly , but once again not work ( when we arrived , we had to ourselves dostovat much luggage and carry in our room ) .
But on the other hand I missed the a la carte restaurants that you have in so many hotels because that 's more pleasant / cosy .
Although the room was small it was clean and quite servicable ( we spent most days sight · seeing in Paris .
Located not in the very center but not in the very outskirts , generally well connected to public transportation .
In my room mattress was ok and it was quiet but I had room with view on wall : ) Most of colleagues were complaining for the mattresses being old and some for noises from outside ( train in particular ) .
Very large resort hotel but we were upgraded to suites on arrival , however these were an extremely long walk from the restaurant / reception approx 500 metres .
Room modern and nice , but from the toilet comes out sewer smell ... terrible !
I would go back but bring my own music for disco : )
While the hotel is in great condition , the service ruined my experience .
At the hotel : rooms are not big , but nice and clean ( I was at this hotel several times and saw different rooms ) , clean comfortable bathrooms .
The hotel is upscale and very expensive .
He was not allowed in the restaurant though , which is also acceptable .
This hotel does not deserve 4 * in my opinion , although in general most of the staff were very pleasant , the upper management were like british politicians , when you complained they did not give you an answer but changed the subject .
Super hotel , perfect service , poor beach
There is no elevator , but the owners ( a young couple ) are very willing to help you with your luggage .
