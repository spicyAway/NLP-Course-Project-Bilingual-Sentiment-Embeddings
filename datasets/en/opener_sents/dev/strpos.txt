Breakfast is highly recommended also , as are drinks in the ( rather pricy ) bar .
Will come back for sure !
Animation is great , especially the cool Riko , that at least speaks english , otherwise prepare yourself to an intensive Russian speaking course .
The meeting room was very well serviced ( the coffee machine was fabulous ) and we were able to focus on our Agenda without having to worry about the operational elements of the visit .
