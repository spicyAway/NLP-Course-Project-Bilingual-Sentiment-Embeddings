There was a breakfast in the Booking page but it was not true.
Cleanliness does not care at all, not the most common, nor the blanket.
It seemed like a "dwarf" shower
Breakfast is very expensive.
Finding the house cost us a lot.
The attitude of the woman who has been working in the morning for most days has been really rough.
Decoration very old fashioned.
The worst, if it's a bad sleep, noise generated by road cars.
The worst thing for me is the toilet.
It's spoiled throughout the hotel and very dirty.
Wi-Fi did not work well anyway, keeping in mind that the holidays are offline everyday ...
Wifia was not doing well.
Look no further than the bed!
We did not like anything.
