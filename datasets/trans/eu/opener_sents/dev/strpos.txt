The house liked a lot, the location too.
The local staff are very friendly.
Everything is perfect, and the doors are open.
Rachel was very nice and helped us to see what he did and how to do it.
We're just a weekend away, and Josep's attention and advice have been great.
The house is very well, a place where there is a kitchen and an outside area.
Amazing !!!
We could not forget staying.
Big kisses for two!
Tasting of different cheeses accompanied by cider, very delicious.
At the end of the day, when the children go, it is a very quiet place.
We were very pleased, the place is huge
We have had a great time at Ada, Luismi and Alicia's house.
We had a great experience.
Very nice room, and breakfast .... how much you remembered with your breakfast in New York, it would be the same, after eating one of your breakfasts! A little bit of luck
We were very well.
It's like going back!

All in all, we were perfectly in Bordaberrin.
The surrounding landscapes are wonderful.
The kids also enjoyed it a lot.
Very good apartment in the XIX century. In the house of a century in the capital of Pulas.

Global breakfasts !!!
We spent a single night in the Areta-Etxea but we found ourselves very pleased.
If we return to Bordeaux, we would definitely stay again at Carole's house.
Spectacle view
For a family of four, excellent.
We have been a couple and a three-year-old daughter, and we've had a great time in the house and environment.
As I say, everything is very well.
