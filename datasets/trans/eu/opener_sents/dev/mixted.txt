it's pretty expensive. he had no fridge. Hotel location and great terraces.
We asked for a double room, but when we arrived we only saw a large bed.
The located street is not far from the center but at night there are not many people walking from there, it is very large and very comfortable
Breakfast is expensive, but maybe even in Paris.
No wifi and square smoke burner do not arrive well, although it is very close.
The hotel, although not in the center, is convenient because it has a tram or subway next to it.
It has a unique decoration but attractive.
There is no signal to reach it A modern, clean and tidy spot.
The house's plot was quite tricky (other terraces), but it's fairly comfortable to rent.
Very good reception, great food, perfect attention, something to say is that the apartments are old but very clean and tidy.
There was a month-old dryer but it was very hard.
