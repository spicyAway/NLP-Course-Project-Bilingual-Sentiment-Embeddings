At the reception there is a lot of staff but not all are competent. The pool is very large and with good facilities. Functions, well-equipped mobile homes, fairly accurate scheduled activities, quiet. Litat and silence at night, the environment is very well cared for.
It is a bit far from the center but it is compensated for the price
Although it is not far from the center, if it is done I have to go up so much, but it's worth it.
Despite being in a room that was facing the main street the noise from the outside did not feel
Prices for expensive services, but in line with the city.
- One of the two mattresses was too soft (it was bad back) - We did not have a window to the outside, it was an open sky - Difficulty finding the public car park - Very central location - Good staffing - Room a bit just (small closet, narrow pass) good value for money when values ​​like central is the pension - Ideal to be able to make tourism during the day and return to the pension only to sleep, I would return - There is a hair dryer - They give shampoo, gel and soap pill
The pool cold water and slippery floor Hotel very centralized
The shower is high and there is no bidet There is no mirror for entire windows There is no elevator The bed, very large and comfortable The small but complete buffet
We did not like that we were not offered compensation for the electric failure of a day and for the low power of contracted light, which made the differential jump jump We liked the apartment, the location and the services
A bit far from the center but there is a bus stop near the hotel at 100m The hotel is perfect, superb price.
The area of ​​the Spa is a bit small and to go there you have to go through the parking lot or go outside. The room is very spacious, the hotel is very well located and the staff are very friendly
A little complicated to arrive by car It is very well located
The location a little away from the center, you have to take the vehicle to move on. The friendliness of the workers.
It looks a bit 'shabby'; 5 minutes from the Guggenheim.
Everything is very deteriorated, the rooms feel everything that happens in the corridor, only And there is a light on the ceiling that is opened by a switch on the side of the door. There are excellent views to the harbor bay tied
It would have been fine a room facing the sea ... but it was more expensive. For the price the breakfast could be included. Excellent location. Very comfortable bed. The room was just as I expected.
Just a great shower.
It feels quite a bit of noise from the corridor, but it does not stop sleeping quietly.
Perhaps the only drawback I have found is that the two bathrooms are located in the upper floor and it was because one of the travelers went with crutches the area is very quiet.
Lloret associates it with a noisy place and this hotel, on the other hand, is on a noisy hill, next to the beach, with beautiful views.
The parking lot can not be booked before and it must be a few places. Very close to the center.
The rooms are very good but I would recommend checking moisture spots in the room and bathroom.
Gross room Staff very attentive at all times; in particular the one of maintenance and the girl of reception.
Despite having a small kitchen, there are no utensils.
On the web it is not clear enough that the pool is not typical of the establishment. A very pleasant place, with a family and sports atmosphere, as well as a great location.
the very hard bed, we could not sleep from back pain. Facilities and a very good situation
The double bed was small and very uncomfortable
The bungalow is good, very good size for 6 people, but be.
- The room was very small - There was a lot of water for the shower - There was not much smell, especially the hallway - One of the receptionists was very poorly educated, did not greet you - etc. etc. The situation, as it was close of the majority of places of interest in Bilbao, although the neighborhood is not of the best of the city
Old hotel but adequate maintenance.
The wall between the two rooms is quite thin. The apartment is very spacious and well equipped with all kitchen utensils, several TVs, and everything new.mm
