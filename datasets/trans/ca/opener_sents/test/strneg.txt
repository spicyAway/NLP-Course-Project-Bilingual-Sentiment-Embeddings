The room is very small.
The normal price is excessive
The carpet was romatic and made a very unpleasant smell of disinfectant.
The beds are not very comfortable.
Very bad in this regard.
The worst is the arrival and departure time of the apartment.
Parking very fair both in width and in number of places.
The facilities are very old-fashioned.
This led to the cold finding of the room when going to sleep.
The pool and jacuzzi are very small due to the number of rooms in the hotel.
The director of the hotel very disagreeable.
Wifi goes fatal.
