Lack of celiac products.
We missed a blow of hose on the terraces near the pool: there were people who had dropped ice cream or drinks on the previous day, and to dry, there were more or less visible stains where you stick your feet to pass it.
Maybe a little expensive
We just missed shelves and hangers in the bathroom, since we were three in the room and in the bathroom there was no where to leave things.
Small room
There was no dryer!
Room with no views, a little claustrophobic.
I think that in general this type of accommodation should provide, apart from 'hardware' of kitchenware (cutlery, pans, toasters, ...) of software (some salt, a ray of oil, dish and washing machine , ...) in this aspect a little bit The situation.
The relation quality price does not correspond.
No signal or no Wi-Fi in the room.
To say something (and obviously this is not attributable to the hotel), the wind ... when the north winds, as the suites are above the hill, it is noted.
They play ball games for children in the pool, which entails many shouts and noises.
Horrible dining room, repetitive food and only for foreigners, without quality and the worst part is that they charge you drinks from meals at scandalous prices and at the time of requesting them.
Although it is only to add a complaint ... There is a hair away from the center of the village to go on foot and close enough to have to take the car.
The rooms that touch the road make more noise.
There is a lack of elevator for the upper floors.
Unused heating switch.
For what I paid I have not had breakfast and the truth is that I have slept in better places for less price.
Breakfast to be a country house could be more natural and varied.
It was hot in the room.
Not all employees are friendly.
Little staff
To be a superior 4 stars, it is necessary to renew especially the furniture of the rooms.
The breakfast does not correspond to the facilities.
The room has a small 5-star hair.
Complicated to find free parking nearby.
You end up wasting the days of your stay.
I did not like that the room we booked made us a double bed when I asked for it expressly.
Lack of soundproofing room, especially from the Location street
The soundproofing and the price of the parking lot fail a bit.
The water had a lot of iron.
The radiators are not adjustable.
I stopped somewhat shorter than I expected.
The problem first of all is the soundproofing of the rooms, when you have someone around you who does not let you sleep and when you arrive late at the hotel all the noise in the morning is unbearable, you can not sleep well.
Our case was that we had two small beds (1x individual 80cm and 1x 'marriage' of 130cm) to sleep three adults over 190cm, asking for an extra (we had requested in the reservation), they tell us not They have everything in the hotel. After more than 2 hours to try to talk to, b a manager at the end there is a room with two beds that very kindly gave us the amount they pay. ah, they do not have a claim book either.
Lacking parking (places are insufficient and â‚¬ 25 a night!!).
Finally they charged us more than what was planned at breakfast (which by the way is very simple).
That the breakfast is not included.
Privacy is needed It did not seem right that you can not order wine at 1 in the morning and let you know that it must be from 4!
The bathroom is a bit simple. The view from the window
It is a hotel for guiris, not for Catalans.
