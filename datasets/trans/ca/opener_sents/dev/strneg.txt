The small room is very small, in the double bed you must enter through the feet of the bed because there is a side touching the wall.
Very unpleasant
Coming from Olot-Vic there is a total lack of directional signaling on the route indicating the monastery of Sant Benet and more at the indicated point of the road change (you can easily find it on the way to Manresa or Terrassa!
Very expensive public parking lots.
The room is very small.
Only one of the nights, in the next room there was a group of young people who came to the party and when they went to the room they made a lot of noise.
