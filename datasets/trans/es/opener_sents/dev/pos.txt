Well located near tracks, but in the middle of the village of Encamp.
I will surely return
Upon entering you are invited to a glass of champagne but we do not take it.
It has no animation, which is appreciated.
I think it's okay to go and have fun with friends as there are many restaurants, bars, pubs and atmosphere to stop it well.
the hotel is in a perfect place to visit the center of madrid, to walk through the door of the sun, plaza mayor etc and tapas in any of the many bars and restaurants in the area, plus the hotel has a subway the door .
From there you can access the entire center of Madrid walking, attentive staff and everything very clean.
The pool is Olympic-sized, and has deckchairs to cover the amount of people staying at the hotel, which is very good, since I stayed at other hotels and they are always in short supply!
My family and I love the city of Madrid, the power to go shopping, to tapas, to see a show, and the situation of this hotel is ideal to move around the center of Madrid without having to take the car because everything it catches you by hand, so that whenever we can plan a weekend family getaway we do not hesitate, our choice is clear: We're going to the Senator Gran Via 21 ¡¡.
I would go back!
Stop at the center
We would like to go back
Gratifying
It is a well located hotel, close to the Plaza de España, with many shops and bars nearby.
Central hotel with good services
A classic of Madrid.
There is wifi in the entire hotel.
It is a good hotel to go with family with permanent activities and a good sector for children, with kindergarten and very entertaining games.
I have been here several times.
Although in Florence everything is accessible on foot I have to say that this hotel is well located, close to the train station and close to all tourist attractions.
The hotel is perfect for not losing a lot of time to stay when you arrive in Dubai, if you arrive at 3 a.m. , for example .
Good buffet, good facilities, location 20 min from the center, with what we had on the beach very quiet. Beach a bit with stones ... I recommend wearing water shoes, and be careful with children: on the shore already covers.
They also have DVD movies that you can rent without any additional cost. and also from Play Station in the room if you want to spend some time playing.
It made me curious that at the end of the hall there was a mosque.
We had a great time, the beach service is excellent, the attention of the people always well prepared and the food varied, for all tastes.
You can walk to the various emblematic places of Rome and the bus and metro stations are within walking distance of the Hotel ..
So it's a place where I think of going back!
The hotel deserves the stars it has, the cleanliness, the spaciousness and the comfort of the rooms are remarkable.
The hotel superbly located, next to the Playas del Duque and close to shopping centers, promenade, apart from being very good, we chose a room with sea views, South orientation, with which all day we had sun, the staff very Friendly and attentive in every way and, in all departments, especially friendly Omar in buffet restaurant and Fernando in attention terrace for dinners.
The attention at the reception was excellent, the staff is very friendly and willing to help the guest.
Quite relaxing and enjoyable, great food, totally recommended.
Especially for the surprise of the SPA.
If you prefer you can use the Tourist Bus with a stop at one hundred and fifty meters.
Excellent service in general I recommend this hotel to all those who are looking to stay in the center of Madrid.
Our apartment overlooked the barbecues and had a view of the coast and the sea by far with a huge terrace where at night it was great.
The buffet was varied and the ones that never tire you because there were always new things to try.
You get a fantastic deal in this great hotel just half an hour from downtown Madrid.
The interior of the hotel is very nice and it separates you from the hustle and bustle outside.
The shows entertain the family at the end of the day.
Rest, mb food and service.
Good hotel
It is a hotel that is very well located, with quick access to the Rome metro.
Its location, a few meters from the train station, is perfect for quick access to the airport.
As a conclusion, it is a good hotel to visit Madrid.
We appreciate the good attention of the staff of the campsite, they even helped us to place the caravan when we arrived.
The rooms are very good, the best beach and pool area.
Good cleaning (although the carpet had some stain).
The room was very spacious and comfortable and we were invited to the spa in a family pass that the children enjoyed a lot.
I recommend it !
We will surely return.
Many of the reception staff, like the one in the restaurant, speak Spanish, they are very friendly and always ready to help you when giving advice about your stay in Munich.
It is classic and well preserved.
I had never been to a campsite and in general it seemed better than I expected, we were in a bungalow plus.
Also nearby is a supermarket and the outputs to the Chianti valley are next to the hotel.
Exceptional service, the room very comfortable, complete and very well soundproofed.
Very well located close to everything
Although the truth was good enough.
The hotel is modern, comfortable, functional.
I will return, no doubt.
The buffet is phenomenal, varied and with some live cooking. The dining room is very comfortable and pleasant.
In addition, it is close to the subway (stop Emirates), which suited us very well to go to the fairground in World Trade Center.
Tranquility and comfort
A very pleasant stay highlighting the treatment of hotel staff and their availability to solve problems that may arise.
A 7.5 for breakfast.
Good rooms; excellent quality of service.
All very clean and well decorated.
Break
A central hotel in Madrid
Friendly staff
We were 7 days that were wonderful, they made us feel like kings at all times, I recommend it and if I went back to Punta Cana, I would definitely choose this hotel ... I thank all the staff for the attention received,
is close to all theaters, cinemas, Plaza Mayor, Sol, shops, museums and I walked everywhere Congress of Neptune deputies, Cibeles.
You also have a subway parda just next door and public parking just behind (with discount for customers, we cost just over € 20 a full day).
I would go back without thinking and consider this hotel one of the best I have stayed in especially for the food.
A very correct hotel and where you can relax in the middle of Tuscany.
Second stay ... and getting better
I have had the opportunity to go to this hotel several times, and it is of course the only hotel in Seville that I consider.
Quiet, luxurious and with a perfect terrace.
Ideal situation 50 meters from Sants station, with taxi rank at the door.
The rooms were super quiet and they always had details with the towels that were beautiful.
An ideal hotel for urban getaways.
Centric and comfortable
The Spa is pretty good.
The truth is that the price is good at least to try it and also in the Gran Vía de Madrid, a luxury.
They have a theater just below where they do monologues, but I recommend booking in advance because it was full when we were there.
