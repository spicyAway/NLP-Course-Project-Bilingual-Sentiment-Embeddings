Excellent location
The hotel in general is fantastic.
excellent facilities, service, entertainment, food, attention in general.
The truth is that the hotel much better than I expected.
The best location in Madrid
The super comfortable beds, and the shower great!
But on the outside we can not help but be surprised by its design, characterized by the terrace, the facade of the hotel, the spectacular views offered both from rooms and from the glass elevators.
On the inside it is very beautiful.
Also the location of the hotel is great because it is very close to the beach and the attention of all the staff very good, it is worth noting that the food is very varied and delicious.
Fully recommended, like the entire Playasenator chain.
The service, the rooms, the pool, the beach and everything in general is excellent.
A hotel located in a very quiet area of ​​Madrid.
Undoubtedly, the stay at the Las Arenas hotel has been an unforgettable experience, a very good treatment, incredible views of the beach.
