The worst was the breakfast, since when arriving all the tables were occupied or dirty, they were slow to give us one in conditions and the general impression is that everything was chaotic.
For the price there are many better ones on the Riviera
It is a small hotel, without big luxuries and with a service senzillo.
There is no elevator, what did you think?
Apart from that the treatment is unkind and clean, well, they make you clean the showers with dirty water and full of hairs, and that paying that if you do not pay ...... I do not know what to do.
As a downside, the rooms are not very different from those of other hotels, that is, you pay more to have a room of small size, with a normal bathtub and a cathode tube television
Type of clientele between regular and bad.
They do not comply with the minimum offer price.
In more than 15 years that I have been traveling with this chain, the hotel in which the treatment, the cleanliness and the details have been, without a doubt, this hotel.
Normal breakfasts, with pastries, cereals and without natural fruit.
The elevator stops between two floors, so you have to go down or up the stairs to get to the room.
We arrived one weekend in July (oddly the warmest of those that had been in Vienna) and the air conditioning did not work.
This hotel needs to improve a lot
Finally the wifi worked a bit regular and the same user, which theoretically lasted 24 hours, as soon as you logged out you lost access and could not reuse it (once again, you had to talk to the reception).
We found it a little excessive that they charged the air service (€ 0.50) to inflate mats, floats, etc ... Internet connection: € 2.5 (very expensive).
Difficult to find parking in surroundings.
I found the only inconvenience at reception, where the workers were not at all friendly, and it is something that surprises, since they tend to be the best in all hotels.
I do not recommend this hotel to anyone to go with family or friends.
I stayed in the Villas in a house where you have to pay more, the waitress goes once a day to clean, has no possibility of any service in the room, it is very far from the hotel services (swimming pools, beach, restaurants ), you have to call to ask for a transport up to 3 times so that they deign to arrive.
However, do not expect luxury.
Sometimes they did not clean the room because we did not have a clear cleaning schedule.
The hotel is totally out of date in terms of furniture and facilities. The air conditioning (only in one room) made a lot of noise.
