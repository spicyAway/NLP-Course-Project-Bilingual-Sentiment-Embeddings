The bathroom is private but it is outside the room and it is very simple.
It has garage of payment for its guests.
Some distance from the center, although well connected by metro / bus.
I do not demand an Olympic, but it is a corridor around the pool that you barely walk and with just two hammocks, and of course it is a very large hotel for so little pool.
The treatment received was unbeatable, in addition as the hotel is under renovation they offer free breakfast to all their clients as well as from 5pm to 7pm you can enjoy wine glasses or beers totally free.
Breakfast, as in all beach hotels, and very friendly staff.
The hotel is located away from the center, although very well connected by the metro, which is only a few minutes away.
Good location, removed from the center but with a metro stop 10 minutes walk, adequate room with large bathroom, excellent staff attention, had several details for being a client for several years, the correct cleaning, in a good hotel to stay in Barcelona
Totalmemte advisable although it is not central
To get to the center with public transport, although it takes about 30 minutes, the tram that passes in front of the hotel goes directly to the dome square
A small hotel with a good presence, close to the Church of San Lorenzo and the Duomo.
On this occasion the parking was managed by an external company and also expensive (â‚¬ 15) closed at 23:00 h which I have not used, but the truth is that I had no problem parking in the area taking into account that my stay has been from Friday to Sunday.
It is a simple hotel, but the best thing is its location: 200 meters from Centrale (the impressive central station of Milan) from where all Milan and the North of Italy is at your reach.
The breakfast buffet was not bad, although it does not have a great variety if there are different options to adapt a bit to all tastes.
The internet is free and goes well, although sometimes it slows down.
Good hotel, located in a quiet area, near the subway, with affordable bars and restaurants, the service and cleaning of rooms did not like anything at all you always had to be claiming something that was missing and we do not understand that if we are four people in the room , there are only services for two.
No frills but comfortable.
I do not like that there are no blinds, The rooms are not big and the two beds, together. the treatment by the staff, very good, and the good services equally.
The metro is nearby, but if you go on foot, it can be a bit long to get to Gran Via.
Hotel located five minutes from all sites, very friendly staff, small room but well equipped and very well soundproofed, has an interior patio with waterfall and plants very nice, breakfast little varied but of good quality.
Good hotel but remote center
