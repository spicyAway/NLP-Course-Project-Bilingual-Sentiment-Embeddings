Unfavorable
Not to repeat
The only but are the meals.
We wanted to see the final of "Let 's dance" on TV, but this one seemed to be older than the hotel and it was tiny and it looked terrible.
Bad to park in the immediate vicinity.
The service is pathetic, we spent a week eating the same, the waiters are salidisimos, everyone wants to get the pasta, in the thematic restaurants it was impossible to book any day, on the beach and the pool impossible to take hammocks, and fumigaban a only once per week therefore all up to bites ..............
It could be better
The second morning I woke up with insect bites, I complained but they did nothing.
Not suitable for people with reduced mobility, since it has very narrow stairs.
the beach full of seaweed, the service of the hotel fatal in all aspects, do not clean the rooms or change the sheets and do not leave towels, we were 3dias without hot water, at 12 at night they are without alcohol, incredible service an all-inclusive of 4 * sup !!!
Only its high price, but being the ritz you know what you're going for.
There are plenty of stars at the hote.
The dwarf room, with the sink and shower in the same room O _ o. Of course, a toilet for the entire hotel, which would deserve to be removed from "hotel" to this cubbyhole.
to put a but, has no parking and you have to leave the car in a parking lot about 300 meters from the hotel.
There was not a lounge for customers, nor restaurants or bars in the vicinity.
The stairs of the reception are impossible for elderly or people with reduced mobility, let's say they are the typical stairs of Holland: narrow and inclined.
The food is quite basic, the thematic restaurants are not what you imagine, they are very structured with respect to the tables and do not understand the language, which is usually annoying.
there are many hotels around do not choose this, I did not believe the comments and fall short. bad bad
And they argue!
Just a little bit good at night, since it is very central and there are always people on the street.
I did not like that the wifi in the rooms is paid and the breakfasts are very expensive.
I have been 3 times and this last one was the worst.
The bathroom reduced, just enough to shower.
The cleaning staff shared the same elevator as us, so going up and down the rooms before and after breakfast became a very complex task.
The only juice was not natural, which in the cafeteria it was.
I answer my phone mvl answer me here there is no mvl phone ... says one of them when we arrived the door was open ... to all this I put a claim and the corresponding police report, the director of the hotel was to call me at Next day a week has passed and I have not received any calls I do not recommend this hotel I think they have those 4 stars.
The recommended areas are 350 m. of the beach
The hotel is not bad for a 2 *.
This time they gave us a room (608) a bit deteriorated (the wall of the room needed a coat of paint because it was full of stains ... kicks ... the headboard of the bed and the fridge door like a world map .. .. scratch spots).
The only drawback is their situation, although, truthfully, it is not something that will reduce many points.
We booked by mail a room with possibility of exterior, at the end they gave us one on the top floor, very small, although within the Amsterdam standards, without wardrobe and only with a TV.
The only thing I could complain about is that the bathroom was so so perfumed that my head hurt ...
The camping Pola is a place not to repeat.
Poor maintenance, rooms with all kinds of defects, claims not solved or answered.
Regular hotel in a bad area
Staff should go to citizenship classes
A little disappointing
Worst of all, it does not have its own garage and parking although it has a special price is a bit expensive for 3 days.
The bathroom in the room very dated to be a four star hotel without a bidet.
Pass hotel
The WIFI is not of good quality, just arrives at the room.
In the dining room it took a long time to clean the remains of the other guests because there were hardly any staff in charge around.
Bad communication with the center.
We were two days without hot water and the hotel staff did nothing to appease us and did not have any details.
