Removals in the repositioning of the minibar and television aside from being bad almost all channels is very old, only those two small details the rest satisfactory, it takes more than half an hour to get to the beach.
The bed somewhat soft but comfortable. The closet is rather small.
Old hotel but central
They offer free massages in the pool, which is impossible to access because the lines are endless.
It is an old hotel that screams for a reform, this good located near the duomo but it is the only thing remarkable, justito service, small rooms, good bed, poor breakfast, in short, not to return
Spacious rooms with spectacular views if you get a high floor.
If you take the mobile of one and that of the couple, plus the laptop, problems; the air conditioner was throwing water in the closet, the TV was completely untuned and there is no technical service for anything; The spider web where the window, accompanied us every day; the wifi works badly and, above, you have to register every two days; the noises of the next room, it is clear no matter how soft it is; The best, without a doubt, is the service and the parking.
Free social Wifi (no wifi with open internet access).
Maybe the bed is uncomfortable, but nothing that spoils the stay.
Currently they are rehabilitating the façade, it would not be bad that in the future they will continue with the baths retiring the bathtubs that will one day give them an upset and the bathroom curtains.
Exceptional, except the rooms.
Normal nothing to note for what it cost us
For the other silent and well located, no problems to park nearby, is the only thing that would save, however I do not recommend it.
Hotel something old but with all the needs covered, central and functional.
The hotel is not located very close to the center, but there is a subway stop practically the side (Gambetta, line 3).
The price in relation to the quality offered is good, and also has a Spa and swimming pool on the roof. the most negative part is the quality of the breakfast, but in global terms the hotel covers the expected expectations.
We made it known to the people who were at the reception and although they were very kind to us, they never fixed it (at least during our stay), which made the trip quite uncomfortable.
The staff is very attentive even if the languages ​​are not your thing ...
Breakfast very good with a variety of products, the restaurant of good quality, to put some but little variety.
Beds of 1.05 quite used, highlight the breakfast, although there was all the variety of other beach hotels, it was very scarce, the cold cuts and the cheese cut very, very fine, they put a bottle of cava that they do not replace when it is finished, the water also you have to be begging to get another bottle. the spa very nice and very careful, the reception very attentive, had the detail of not charging anything to leave a few hours but the car in the garage.
Food is not that I like it very much, but it was not bad either.
The friendliness of the very good staff and the cleanliness should improve a bit.
As for the price, I must admit that I accepted an offer with time and it seemed very profitable, but of normal because the location of this hotel is paid.
Well, with details to improve
I chose the hotel because it is close to the AVE station and it is true that it is a 15 minute walk and one metro stop (which is 1 minute walk) but the area at night is quite bad.
nice hotel in madrid that surprised me by the kindness that we treated both my husband and I had a problem in the room and immediately everything and no problem arose and they apologized me when I returned to madris sure I return here
The rooms are neat, although they have a little small beds.
It is a pretentious hotel, that is to say it pretends to be what it is not. It stayed in the 70s and although it has been renovated, it is still old. The staff of the horel is friendly.
The treatment at reception is not good, it is excellent, unsurpassed.
Despite having several pools, you have to get up early to catch amacas.
In the end you get into the Spa although small and come out as new.
It was small but very cozy.
Hotel not too modern, but well adequate.
The buffetes are fine, but the staff unfriendly.
There was some noise from the adjoining rooms but not too annoying.
To apologize for having assigned us an untreated room they sent us a bottle of cava without a bucket or glasses ... we had to go and ask for them and wait a long time to get them ...
The reception staff was great, although I had to wait forever because there were a lot of people and a lot of queue
do not expect much from the hotel, just for a weekend, the hotel itself is well located, 50 mtrs underground station capricho.zona very quiet and there cercanos.para breakfast parks give you a ticket and you have to go to a restaurant near the hotel, but it is very good.Close to the hotel there is a restaurant that for dinner is fantastic, good value for money.the staff of the hotel receptionists (the girl in the morning is very friendly and efficient, but the receptionist later he is incompetent and attention to the customer fully nefasto.no about cleanliness, somewhat deficiente.no expect this very clean, we went to use the crockery and the apartment and everything was dirty and greasy, horrible.
And although the reception was twenty-four hours by asking if you could go out for a walk in the reception you told us no.
In general it is a good hotel, spacious, very well-kept rooms, clean, although not every day the sheets changed, the breakfast buffet, to my taste, was scarce and a quite tenpranero schedule.
That is the only fault I find, otherwise everything is fine.
there is free WIFI, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, the bathroom is correct and they have a good terrace. the breakfast was not plentiful, but of very good quality, that if the common areas are a bit old.
