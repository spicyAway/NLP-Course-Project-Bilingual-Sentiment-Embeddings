with my wife, we rented a room in this hotel, the first hotel, and what a welcome we got on arrival! they said that they had some problems with some of their clients who had taken pictures in their hotel without their permission. when we arrived, they forced us to open our suitcases and search them to see if we did not have a camera. we did not accept, by principle, and they would not let us go! so we had to find another hotel at the last minute! I do not recommend this hotel at all, the welcome is worthy of a hotel pass ...
Craftsman serious plumber on Paris 11th rates are clear and reasonable a good plumbing address in Paris
a stone's throw from luxembourg, senate and sciences-po, this magnificent church is an interesting monument to visit. it is from the outside that he is the most impressive. its size, its architecture can only make us feel very small next door. a beautiful fountain on the forecourt makes the place rather pleasant to land.
Friendly hotel, but we prefer the small mansions full of charm which is filled the neighborhood.
hotel of very good quality or the rooms are clean, the home is impeccable. Newspaper service is offered as well as hot drinks in the rooms. nothing to say about the cleanliness of the rooms. I recommend it.
hotel very well located in the montparnasse district, close to the garden of luxembourg and close to restaurants. Friendly and very helpful host. the breakfasts are great. the room is small but functional and the air conditioning was very much appreciated.
an acceptable room considering the prices and the neighborhood, but a bed for 2 people catastrophic. how can we dare to offer 86 euros per night (anyway) a bed smashed with a central bowl as we wake up every hour because we slip
I am delighted to have had such a pleasant time with my companion in your hotel! ideal for a romantic weekend to stroll in the Latin Quarter! thank you to all the team of your home, your hotel is a gem!
The hotel was recommended by friends, it was my surprise a few days to spend at the hotel, at first I took a night to see, but later, I lengthened my stay and I regret not to the warm welcome, even their microwave and personal fridge is available to guests by simple request, even the breakfast is affordable 3 €, in addition to the room that is not expensive with a free shower on the landing , and channel + channels and wifi which was my surprise compared to the price, the only inconvenient not CB, but generally acceptable for a room with shower and toilet between 51 61 €
we chose this hotel to participate in the lounge batimat following the description of the site. we were very disappointed as the hotel is a bit old and the amenities are poor. moreover, if you stay on the upper floors, you have no water. and the staff does not care. we were not able to benefit from a discount due to inconvenience. we strongly discourage this hotel! !
there are renovated rooms and other no, which changes the value for money ... very much that everything is renovated ... it will be perfect ... I once had a room that left something to be desired especially the bathroom (faucet leaking, impossible to empty the sink, window that closed badly ...). more or less noisy depending on the room. Regular customer of the hotel, I must still recognize that in the majority of cases there is not much to say about the service. friendly staff and breakfast ok
problem poorly insulated rooms you can hear everything going on in the next room! breakfast limit; a mini buffet would be better. Other than that, price / quality ratio very correct.
horrible hotel, shabby, dirty, made of odds and ends, breathing insecurity in the nose (especially when a prostitute makes the tap in front of the entrance and takes her customers back to this pigsty) ... do not believe srtt the few quot; testimonials quot; positive about it, which are without any doubts deposited by employees of this hotel to raise its rating and deceive people by touting non-existent qualities! run away ! !
Perfect ... only downside ... a bit expensive.
Unworthy pizzeria, the pizzas are served in dessert plates. on the card the price is ok but when you see the pizza arrive; sodebo quot; the scam is here. as usual the restaurants near the train stations are to be avoided. I do not even mention tiramisu quot; home quot; from metro to 8euros ....
at younice is a great Moroccan restaurant! served by younice itself, you will not be disappointed by the warm welcome and delicious typical dishes that take you directly to Morocco thanks to the flavors and warm atmosphere of the restaurant! really cheap for quality and quantity (no more than 11 € for tagines and 9 € for kebabs). to recommend in fact the very good value for money and above all an owner who deserves to be known! to make known to all your entourage! takeaway also. (you can if you wish to bring back to the restaurant with you your bottle of wine).
hello we just spent the weekend, and I want to thank you for the welcome, the kindness of the staff. we will be back for sure. see you soon
Hello, a very good price / quality ratio. Very nice home .
my experience at the Hotel Maxim was most unpleasant and I do not think I can attribute this to bad luck. from the management to the morphology of the rooms, all bell. the overall quality is below the standard two stars and certainly does not deserve 125 euros. firstly, the cleanliness is downright deficient. stained sheets (which stayed there all week), sticky shower curtain, dusty surfaces. the deco, who has seen branche et moderne, is it well if I went that I'm in disrespectful défraîchi and you overwhelm. the mattress is antediluvian, the shower is Lilliputian (even according to Paris standards) and the water jet without pressure. in wishing to shorten my stay, I hit an arrogant staff and very little accommodating. One night, I even had to spend 15 minutes in front of the front door of the hotel, ringing constantly, without anyone coming to open me. only advantages the location, the quiet street ... but they can not compensate for the lack of professionalism of this establishment.
Great location in the Latin Quarter, a chic and design hotel completely redone. the staff is very hospitable and attentive, the services are upscale, bedding top, parquet floor, decor. very nice. , eco label home products. in addition to two steps from the metro goblins and surrounded by bus lines to access all the monuments to visit. to try absolutely; d
an open and available staff, a newly renovated room, quiet, close to several metro, good value for money to know.
friendly welcome. hearty breakfast. restaurant good value for money. quiet but room and bathroom small and old.
Average hotel, noisy (device) although I asked for a quiet room, room seen on the ring road. on arrival room wide open to everyone. no wifi on the 4th floor because too far from the source.bien expensive for the benefit.
good then, what shocked me is dirt. the lack of hygiene, I was disgusted, but ... the reception is very good, breakfast too, although quite stressful (indeed the room is too small compared to the number of customers) for one or two nights it goes! and I forgot the rooms are overheated (I did not find a way to lower the radiator thermostat!)
Charming hotel, there is a very nice stairs-library. the rooms are spacious, the shower rooms are well optimized but narrow. the reception is pleasant.
very friendly and very professional welcome, massage of the same ilk, a real moment of relaxation and an oriental getaway at the gates of Paris; remains a little expensive for my taste, but they are tariffs that must avoid a certain population and allow them this status!
3 day stay we wanted cheaper, but served! washbasin, shower, toilet, in a tiny hallway, en enfilade, you shower, to go to the toilet you soak your feet since you have to walk in the shower! , 2 small towels to wipe (couple), creaky doors (entry and bathroom) inexpensive 7.5 euros for coffee with rest of washing up liquid! (that bubble and gout infect) the 2nd day, more coffee on the 3rd day, (8h15!) a piece of white bread (at will) and a short croissant, very disappointed, we will go elsewhere ... in autumn
very good address in Paris, a b amp; b as we like a home top, small dej very well and neat, the room is not very large, but the bed and bedding are at the top. Yes, the villa is out of the way and not close to metro stations, but this is compensated by the calm of the quariter, the Velib stop just below (as well as a bus stop). sound insulation between rooms is not terrible; but that did not prevent us from sleeping very well. globally to advise.
