Well placed, some personal hospitality is particularly welcoming and accommodating.
the studios are small but practical, functional and very clean.
wifi connection rj45.
free internet downstairs at the reception.
car wash matic level -1. waste separation .
small bag available if you want to do your shopping next to the simply market.
in short, very good, even if the prices are very high, like everywhere in the neighborhood.
we took a room at this hotel on December 31, 2009; and, although the time spent in this one was very short, we would have had to abstain from sleeping, and make a sleepless night ... that would have cost us less, and at least we would not have suffered all the night , odors, mites, cold, bad general condition of the room.
in short, I do not recommend this establishment, and you should also be wary of presentations made on the net.
friendly hotel.
good value for money, especially since it is very well located.
the reception is pleasant and the breakfast room looks like a German-pratin vault!
sad experience for me.
radiator down in the middle of January dubious cleanliness.
To this is added the very petty way that the front desk did not tell you on arrival that your breakfast will be charged.
you will find yourself at the handing over of the keys to have to pay a huge sum.
I avoid this hotel and advise against my loved ones
I have been wondering for more than 1 hour why the employees of the post office do they phone them it is impossible to reach them especially in the 92 I tried all the phone numbers that I found the post platform parcel in any j have tried 6 different number tjr put on hold and never anyone at the end of the wire it is 10:35 and I began looking for my package around 9:15. it's just a shame what horror the world will not change is there are still gents like the postal workers ... do you really want my opinion of course that no
Negative room very outdated, no free wifi as displayed, noisy, minimal comfort, cleanliness doubtful.
does not match the description on the site!
High rate for this type of hotel 77 euros single room.
in a dead end, hotel very clean, very quiet.
courteous welcome by a friendly and considerate receptionist.
room in very good condition.
only reserve not found the electric plug for the razor in the bathroom!
shabby hotel.
old, dirty and poorly equipped.
very noisy single glazing next to Boulevard de la Gare de Lyon.
to avoid at all costs.
hotel arenes has too many stars small rooms not very clean bathroom unhygienic staff not gracious for a double room booked we are given a triple room with 3 small beds!
very poor value for money we will not go back
free wifi public transport the staff is very nice i really love this hotel all the chain novotel is not bad I do not want to go anywhere else that down I love the pool is very heated and it is not regrettable in short is at the top!
never come to this hotel.
the staff is not understanding.
be careful because the cancellation policy is very poorly written and therefore difficult to understand.
Do not stay at this hotel.
an average hotel, but the proximity to the train station is convenient.
I enjoyed the bath.
on the other hand it is sorely lacking a minibar and air conditioning in the rooms in summer, the heat is difficult to bear ...
I enjoyed this small hotel simple and welcoming.
a smiling staff and really nice (it's not so common in our dear capital).
a single room without more or less, perfect bedding, the street is quiet (well I went on a Monday night).
the breakfast is already prepared when you arrive, you do not have to go to help yourself and the coffee arrives quickly.
In short, nothing to say!
rotten!
this hotel is in line with most 2 * amp hotels; 3 * from Paris to know very old local tourist catchers, tiny rooms / bathrooms and unhealthy limit with prices up to our disappointment!
therefore to avoid absolutely.
an adorable service for a small cafe on zinc before work by chatting or reading the news of the day available ... momo always has a smile!
if there is noise, it is because we are in Paris we have answered you!
for the proposed rates (even if we are in Paris) we could wait better; walls sheets cigarettes, no one that morning in breakfast room, impressment em em ... ..er this morning or we simply asked for a new room.
wrong address !
my parents, aged, spent 2 nights for the end of year holidays 2012. they did not have heating and a water damage took place in the room.
they had to change it.
not to mention the greeting, we managed to see a manager only when paying.
this one was bad faith and very aggressive.
the breakfast was not served on the 2 days, by lack conclusion hotel definitively to be avoided, in full decadence.
a good hotel, not luxurious but clean and with a good welcome.
I spent 3 nights here with a friend.
I asked for a double room, we had to settle for a large bed ... the bedding is in very bad condition, I woke up with body aches, the lighting of the bathroom (above the mirror did not work ! )
, the cleanliness leaves something to be desired.
the bed was not made on the 2nd day, the bedspread was just pulled on the sheet .. the breakfast is average, the coffee undrinkable!
the staff does not speak French, and is obviously not professional.
the positive sides quiet room, near the goblins (5 minutes walk), well located in Paris.
we stayed 10 days in the city.
we have only good to say about this place.
As soon as we arrived very early in the morning, our room was ready.
we felt at home as soon as we entered the apartment.
it's very big, surprising even.
full kitchen, dishwasher, microwave, wireless internet, everything is there.
the staff is very kind, attentive and knowledgeable.
a shopping center is in the same building.
therefore, all the businesses we need are below us.
Our trip consisted of visiting Paris.
we only had to cross the street to get to the metro and so did not waste time.
I recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to go with family or friends and live in the same apartment.
it's the ideal, believe me!
thank you to the city.
we had a wonderful trip and it's a lot thanks to you.
thank you !
bad experience of burglary (several hundred euros) in the room while it was closed and the key was at the reception.
the staff is unfriendly, unhelpful, irresponsible and disrespectful.
the management is absent and obviously hated by the staff.
searching on the internet other customers have already reported flight problems.
it is a shame for the chain ibis and accor.
it is obvious that I recommend to everyone to avoid this hotel more than doubtful and to go elsewhere to have a pleasant stay!
Subway vibrations felt slightly until 1am (it's not their fault) scandal no rate posted!
no real dining room for breakfast and do not expect to choose your jam ... the bed is good channel yes but do not dream of the satellite ... and the TV is very bad!
no room for the legs in the toilet (room 16) short we are far from a hotel at 80 €!
50 € would be a correct price!
deplorable home behavior on the verge of aggression on arrival and departure not the room on the third is not soundproofed for indoor noise.
the tapestry and carpet very damaged, chromo on the wall to hide one of the many holes is unbearable to look at.
obviously the remote works halfway.
the hotel obviously receives a lot of tourists, it is a shame for the Parisian hotel industry.
in positive, apart from the location, I do not see.
there are dozens of hotels at this price in Paris where, at least, the reception is correct.
very good reception, attractive prices.
the rooms are correct, have tv, shower and wc.
in the morning, breakfast is enough.
only small negative bridge, the size of the bathroom.
I recommand it .
very pleasantly surprised because I was expecting a cold and austere stay in the image of the architecture of the office building 80 's!
it's a very good idea to have played the contrasts by a hobby in color, a little club med, i-tech with electrical outlets everywhere, including the small room dej, multimedia airlock in the lobby with pc, printers and lan plug, video entrances near the bed to connect his pc to the tv and a large and attentive staff.
great idea to have the door of the corridor (in the rooms) to isolate noise!
it's rare .
+1 for the breakfast buffet which is not quot; continental quot; but very varied and with a real orange juice in a hurry!
+1 also for the space quot; child quot; , the small multilingual library, the press available and the cleanliness of the place.
Only weak point, the rooms are not glamorous and we will avoid coming for a honeymoon.
Other than that, it's a good address.
comfortable hotel 3 nights out of 4 Thursday night was quot; stirring quot; from 4 am if you need to travel with medications that require refrigeration you are told that there are no problems when booking.
then on arrival, you are told that it is exceptional and that the package must be small.
