__label__strpos excellent acceuil near gare de lyon rooms redone to nine unbeatable value for money

__label__strpos we were there twice, one of which we could not cruise because of the flood. We were therefore offered to come back for a second time free of charge. the meal was good without being sensational, at the price of the cruise we wish better. the staff was friendly (the second time). the restaurant is well decorated, and the cruise was nice even if in the end we do not see as many buildings we would have liked to see. the room was very small, but sufficient. in summary, beautiful cruise .... however a little expensive (in our case it was a groupon offer, so the price was interesting.)

__label__strpos good quality comfort like service. breakfast is too expensive for a low quality.

__label__strpos hotel well located, very welcoming, impeccable service, security, personal attention ... really deserves a few more stars! nothing to do with a hilton, but everything depends on what you are looking for. absolutely ideal for tourism or work. After all, you do not live all day in your hotel room when you visit Paris! Everyone knows what he wants, but we can only recommend this hotel and congratulations to all his staff! ronald fries venezuela

__label__strpos the bar-hotel quot; the cosy quot; is a place conducive to calm and relaxation. ideal for lunch and dinner very good food, or just have a drink with friends. the staff is welcoming and the terrace in summer and winter ideally arranged for large groups.

__label__strpos everything is small but functional, nice new decor

__label__strpos ++ friendly staff, clean hotel, warm atmosphere. well located to travel in paris by subway a few rooms a little small, as well as breakfast area, to refresh

__label__strpos the carpet in the room is very dirty not sucked and many stains and burning of cigarettes. defective heating knob. cleanliness of the room generally bad, only the friendliness of the staff raises the level

__label__strpos a charming hotel design, warm and quiet with spacious rooms completely renovated and comfortable bedding. the district is alive and typically Parisian, the lines of transport are direct for all the main axes. the staff is welcoming always available at the slightest request. to recommend

__label__strpos This is the hotel where we do not hesitate to book during our stays in Paris, even with our 4 year old daughter. it is ideally located in a quiet neighborhood amp; nice a few steps from the italy square. easily accessible by public transport. the reception is good. the staff present, nice amp; warm. the bedroom amp; the commons are very clean amp; convenient . breakfast is properly stocked. only one thing is missing a second electrical outlet in the bedroom area.

__label__strpos no clear and maganific room. French charm. neighborhood a bit noisy but well located, excellent starting point for visits. breakfast ok, home satisfactory. to advise for a city trip in love. I would go back. out is wonderful to discover absolutely the best hotel in paris the rooms are sumptuous the service is impeccable kindness and proximity to the guests excellent value for money and ideally located

__label__strpos do not confuse hotel ibis place d'italie, and the avenue d'italie a few hundred meters away. No problem for me (I never leave money in the room). nice staff. clean and comfortable rooms.

__label__strpos excellent location ...

__label__strpos small hotel value for money. rooms cramped but clean and comfortable beds. friendly welcome, breakfast served in the room on request. try to take advantage of advantageous promotions because the standard prices tend to be high for the size of the rooms. Nice neighborhood in front of a police station (but not too noisy).

__label__strpos Positive hotel well placed, metro station 100 m. very quiet street. the rooms are clean, well soundproofed and the bedding is very correct. breakfast for 8 euros per pers is ok. negatives the director wants the payment of the room upon your arrival attention contrary to what is announced, no hair dryer in the room. limited services but only 2 star hotel! conclusion good value for a hotel in paris

__label__strpos go there with your eyes closed! a consistent price, a quality hotel! all is well ! (maybe the wifi would be a plus ...)

__label__strpos hotel very well located in the village of bercy with a metro mouth at 50m. surrounded by nice restaurants. clean room and good bedding. breakfast well provided. I recommend this hotel after a motorcycle show in Bercy

__label__strpos a bit expensive but we are in Paris! they have made efforts on the quality of rooms but it is still missing a few square meters! !

__label__strpos very classy hotel, clean and communicating rooms for big families. TV with large channels (all tnt), internet connection, restaurant on the ground floor overlooking the Palais Omnisport. the hotel is close to all Paris thanks to the metro.

__label__strpos very good value for money 70 € per night for studio 2 people clean and spacious very good reception private parking of the hotel in the basement at attractive price 10 € / day metro and bus nearby we did not have breakfast at 8 € because fully equipped room (kitchenette with fridge, microwave, coffee maker, dishes ...) and bakery 20 m. I recommend

__label__strpos I think 160 € for a night is more than exaggerated knowing that the bed is not even good

__label__strpos Small clean hotel but double bed not large enough for 2 people. it is better to privilege the rooms on street (not very noisy). staff at the professional reception. However, room rates far too high or excessive for the quality of rooms, the situation in Paris and the services offered.

__label__strpos arrival in the room not done household, condom under the bed, string in the shower, tumblers users, wet towel ... obliged to change rooms and no commercial gesture from the hotel. We expect a minimum of quality in an ibis hotel, which I clearly have not found in this one.

__label__strpos very friendly hotel and good value for money

__label__strpos this hotel is located really near the place de la Bastille but especially near the palace bercy (in the 12th), which is very convenient when you come for one of its events (we came to Paris for a concert) . our stay was very good, we were welcomed very warmly, and slept very well. an address that I advise.

__label__strpos the rooms great owl but a little small .... the neighborhood is cool and quite calm. and people of the hotel are hypersympa ....

__label__strpos Economically affordable, I made a 2 night stay in early October. housed in a single room on the 3rd floor, overlooking the corner of rue gossec and rue de picpus. calm and pleasant environment. good reception at the reception. renovated room, with all the necessary furniture, closet, desk, a bathroom (provide his soap and shower gel ^^) and toilet. good wi-fi connections in the hotel, flat screen tv. no breakfast or catering, but we find happiness on the boulevard dosmenyl or by going on the golden door. When I was there, the hotel was still undergoing renovations and the elevators were being installed.

__label__strpos warm welcome, attentive masseuses, well-kept places, the scenery of thailand ... and all for a very good price ... why not

__label__strpos for the price, it's really ok. room very small but nothing to complain about, clean. Bathroom really small not ideal when you are big (or fat). central taps (sink and shower) not perfect, but ok ... for 1 or 2 nights max. and just to sleep from 23h to 7h. again, very good value for money.

__label__strpos a very well located hotel that I frequent regularly for almost 10 years. I still knew him before the renovation. never disappointed and always very welcome. the rooms are small but clean. the showers upstairs are good and clean. nothing to say . breakfast good and you can eat at will. I recommend this hotel to 100 and I'm going back again this summer

__label__strpos super stay. Great bathrooms. excellent bedding. quiet . friendly staff. pdj complete. pity that it is often full, must be booked in advance if possible

__label__strpos a week passed indeed just for sleeping. no tv in the rooms, .repas of the evening limit, no choice so meal taken outside.

__label__strpos excellent reception. you immediately feel like at home. the apartment is very clean, the bed comfortable. it's really an excellent address.

__label__strpos we spent 3 nights in peace. good internet reception, clean room and especially a very friendly welcome. reservation made by phone with confirmation by fax impeccable. Very good value for money
