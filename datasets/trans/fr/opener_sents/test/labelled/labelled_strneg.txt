__label__strneg I stayed at the hotel on the 4th of September in September 2013 with my husband, we were in a deluxe room which was very bright. the staff was very smiling and listened to what I appreciated. moreover the hotel is very well located close to metro stations vavin, montparnasse and notre dame des champs. we keep very good memories hoping to stay there during our next trip to paris.

__label__strneg no, no, and no! after a deplorable welcome, surprised to find a very small room (less than 5 cm between the door of the room and the bed!) , with a superb door quot; it can not be more ordinary quot; (ie non-acoustic hollow cell type!) overlooking the next room, which allows us to follow everything that happens in the next room! (and conversely ...) then find that the sheets are stained, that the mold remains in the shower, accumulation (and the word is weak!) dust to the exhaust mouth of the vmc, forgetting a sponge (dirty recess) on the windowsill ... not to mention that the front door that gives directly to the outside is quot; veiled quot; , so let the air pass considerably, as well as the rubber seals of the window that quot; dangle quot; outside ... no one, no and no! !

__label__strneg .. can be much better by putting tomato ... however the concept is good and attractive price especially if you are hungry before going to the movies. once again you have to put less fat and more tomato, because otherwise it is really indigestible which is shameful when you take a pizza with vegetables on it ...

__label__strneg very welcome, very nice furniture, but particularly dirty! 1st chb sink clogged; 2nd chb proposed coffee drips on the radiators, rust, black joints in the shower, thick carpet unhygienic bed cover very very doubtful, we did not change the sheets of the week when it should have been done, not Alaises on the mattresses and we followed the green advice to keep the towels (paper displayed on the doors) and there we were changed (when it should not ..). big problem of interest of the managers to the finishes, dirty ceilings, paving put by a pig, basic cleaning baclé. does not deserve its 3 stars.

__label__strneg Disappointment ... the room allocated had not been cleaned, which did not worry the staff, despite the high price of the room for only 10sqm bathroom included. heating to a maximum also allowed to exceed 30 ° C, a record for one month in April. the breakfast consisted mainly of bread and dry pastries, already visible at the arrival of the day before.

__label__strneg expensive for a room with a non-functional heating, not clean and a small dej without bread and too many industrial products

__label__strneg good hotel and very good for the cartier! !

__label__strneg good reception, nice performance I would return with pleasure

__label__strneg very friendly staff but we enter the room in the middle of the day carpet does not burn water in the toilet for example room 24 can not call the hotel a trickle of water in room 14 to flee 1/20 for the reception very nice

__label__strneg attracted by the location we had the misfortune to sleep in this hotel. our rooms were dirty, stinking and outdated and for coronne all the people from the charming reception to the reservation was reluctant very disfavorable thereafter. the hotel cactus is aptly named! It hurts to settle there. to avoid absolutely! !

__label__strneg I did not see a rat, but as many rat traps in the halls to the rooms, it does not put in trust! I never had the courage to sit on the chair or the bedspread or walk barefoot on the carpet.

__label__strneg go your way! Dirty hotel, not heated at the November self and the receptionist has me mugged ...

__label__strneg we booked through the internet a few days ago and when we arrived there was a mistake booking, we had to transfer to the opposite hotel which was not more welcoming. Same receptionist for both hotels, so there was no one when we arrived.

__label__strneg hotel to avoid absolutely! do n't go there , if you 're from abroad the reception are going to be so ugly that you 're stay in france will be a nightmare ... .. ! deplorable home, 3 receptionists, 3 employees that annoy you heavily! Lost keys, change your room, wake up at 8 am They enter your room and are not happy to find you there! , private conversations while you wait (yes but she stops the pizza is over ...) we warn you if there is no one at the reception is that it is in the bathroom and that it can last long ... . Are they so poorly paid that the money was used to pass this potentially 1 star falsely 3 to avoid carefully, there are plenty of other hotel far better and mins expensive! !

__label__strneg a good hotel to recommend. very nice welcome, good information, the proximity to the porte de Versailles and montparnasse train station make it an excellent base.

__label__strneg welcoming and friendly. no problem . propreté r.a.s.

__label__strneg sometimes, nothing goes! I missed the last train to Nantes, so I find myself spending the night in this ibis hotel next to the train station. 180 € all the same, for an ibis it hurts, but it's paris ... after a few minutes, I realize that a blower emanating from the air conditioning system is very noisy and especially does not stop , even when cutting the heating. moments later, I realize that regular whirring tremble my room the metro! (I was on the ground floor.) it is written everywhere; we are committed to finding a solution to your problems in 15 minutes quot; . so I go to the home so they stop this blower no idea why the how, and no technician available. so I stayed with my problem. it is also written snacks 24/24 with a tempting card as I had to work, I opt for this option. I will order at the reception, and there the anguish oula that we have not, that we have not, sorry ah I think we have not ... in short they had a hot dish and a yogurt from breakfast to me to propose . So shit night when you hold us! thank you ibis

__label__strneg to avoid . very expensive and personal at the reception very unpleasant.

__label__strneg room small and noisy. welcome without explanation, hardly hello.

__label__strneg hotel very nice and very convenient because located less than 150 meters from the montparnasse station! the reception is very warm! I highly recommend it

__label__strneg I do not like the bed. it was small for 2 people

__label__strneg Blah, apart from the bathroom which was redone but very cramped, the decor of the room and the hotel rather passed. the sheets and blankets no freshness, on the contrary. greeted by the receptionist who ironed sheets and towels in the entrance / small lounge. a mini fridge in the room but that does not work. positive point its location in the heart of montparnasse district.

__label__strneg I stayed three nights from April 10, 2013 to April 13, 2013 at the hotel clairefontaine rue fermat, the first two nights as a professional and the third privately. Arriving on April 10 late, I found that the ramp inside the stairs (which must be borrowed because there is no elevator) is poorly fixed and even not fixed. I also found as the previous user that the soundproofing was very bad but the tenants realized this defect and were very quiet. the reservation had been made (by booking for the first night then by phone for the next two nights) in a very friendly way, the location of the host is very convenient between montparnasse and denfert, two floors of the hotel form a very nice patio very nice when it is beautiful, the room I occupied the third was very clean and very spacious, the bed was very good. the hotel was redone two years ago it seems and I had already spotted (in case the 2 hotels where I usually stay, much cheaper, are taken) because the rue fermat is very quiet. my shower was leaking and creating an unpleasant noise. One of the hotel patrons told me (helping me to make a coffee) that the water temperature of his shower was impossible to adjust. On the 11th in the morning I absolutely had to have breakfast at 7:00. bread, coffee and croissants were only available at 7.18. on the 12th in the evening when I returned I noticed that my room had not been made. On the morning of the 13th, I did not pay attention to the fact that 3 breakfasts had been counted whereas I had only consumed 2 of them. the bill was however drawn up according to my request in two parts, the Friday being apart. on the morning of the 13th, the cafe's coffee was cold. the reception person kindly but unsuccessfully attempted to operate one of the coffee machines. so I had tea. When I came back for my baggage on the evening of the 13th, I pointed out these problems to the person at the reception who seems to be the person in charge. he simply answered me in a way that surprised me so much that I did not reply quot; I know all that. it does not matter . we depend on bakers for bread and croissant. a room not made once in three nights it happens. quot; the person refunded the extra breakfast without comment or goodbye. that there are problems in a hotel that is possible and may be due to buildings, repairs, materials and staff. a hotel is a difficult business to manage and everything is not perfect in the material world ... I understand all this and it is explicable. but let the customer be told quot; it's not serious quot; That is to say, why do you make a story that reflects a contempt of the client that is incompatible with the hotel business that must be based on hospitality. all this is a shame because for 110 euros breakfast 10 euros it seems to me that the defects that I reported (breakfast not ready, problematic showers, room not made) should be the subject of corrective action as soon as possible. I am sorry to have to write such a harsh comment, it never happened to me, but the way my comments were handled at the hotel compels me to do so. jean-rené kerjean

__label__strneg good value for money and quiet and a good welcome a hearty breakfast

__label__strneg no parking . 1h to go around in circles to find places. forgetting the delivery of the evening meal, obliged to call back. the seven burger is the charal burger large supermarket to put 40 seconds in the microwave (I know him well) with a bit of low-end chips. The ambience of the levitation room is good but the rooms are very small. shower friendly but no separation between the bathroom and the room. chaste couples abstain. good breakfast with choice of delivery time. we had a good time in love but we will not come back.

__label__strneg clean, but old, poorly insulated, super noisy (no wifi! pity because 2 steps from the Montparnasse district.

__label__strneg the hotel of the green mill in paris surprised me by its conviviality. it is simple but comfortable, good mattress, silent, friendly service and smiling. to summarize the hotel of the green mill is to know for all those who must make a stopover in this district of paris.

__label__strneg nice decor but small room, half-clogged shower and hairdryer hs.

__label__strneg my favorite hotel chain, for my work travels, I always look at home first. best western combines tradition and modernity, great value for money, comfortable rooms, and friendly staff. I highly recommend .

__label__strneg Friendly hotel, attentive and helpful staff, breakfast very good. only defect the walls in quot; paper quot; you hear too much noise in the adjoining rooms.

__label__strneg fred'hotel, very welcoming and calm, to go down there is to feel in family. I have known him for 33 years. thank you vidal and at one of these days, good luck.

__label__strneg hotel very good location very good staff and a receptionist very very nice and attentive to customers ... hotel very cheap and with comfort! very good hotel not expensive ... i do not understand the other reviews of other cilents who are not satisfied fu the hotel i think they are a little demanding. ... but for me it recommended with eyes closed. thank you all the team of the hotel.

__label__strneg Not good for one to two nights. shower a little noisy. no hook in the room to hang towels. otherwise c nice.

__label__strneg dirty bad welcome lil dej restricted

__label__strneg beautiful family room. the service is a little soft to `home and on the floors ...

__label__strneg Staff quite warm and welcoming, good quality room, average quality but interesting price. good overall experience the receptionist gave me several leaflets and even helped me to get a metro ticket so that I could go to the Louvre.

__label__strneg Staff not nice and not friendly we have the impression to disturb them. the rooms are ... tired or even ... vents clogged with scotch ... dirty wallpapers ..., there is no other words, breakfasts take it anywhere but not there. ..

__label__strneg The common circulatiosn are a little tired but the rooms have every comfort and are very clean. the decor is pretty good. As there are only 3 tables for breakfast, I recommend the bakery / tea room down the street, cheaper and copious.

__label__strneg very good value for money..very nice room breakfast .. buffet at will ..room clean ..wifi free ds all the hotel, smiling home, listening and especially very helpful.

__label__strneg cramped room under the stairs, space reduced to the bare minimum ... for one night, alone, it passes ...

__label__strneg the critics fuse side clientel. as an artist, it's not better. the director is antipatic, he tuts without asking, and to top it off, he never paid us our intervention.

__label__strneg the picnic was good

__label__strneg Hotel quite small but very well placed (in the center of Paris). we had breakfast there, it was decent. pity the elevator is so small but apparently hard to do otherwise.

__label__strneg it's a shame how can you sell nights in these conditions! I was late posting my opinion since it took me 3 days to recover in sleep. we arrive at the hotel welcome, I open the door of the room, first surprise the photos of the site should not be contractual because there was no relation to the pictures seen on the site. Second observation, everyone could not have resided there, only small people and small weights could access the toilet and shower. but the worst moment for me was that of sleeping a mattress with a huge hole in the center certainly due to the many passages. having got up in the morning at 04h I thought I was going to fall like a mass but with the condition of this mattress I am gone for a long night's sleep ... hell went on with the coffee or beverage machine who was standing in front of my door, needless to say how nice it is at 3am to hear a customer serving himself, or the sound of refrigera- tion getting on the road every few hours. and then miracle, I fell asleep under the soft rocking of the neighbor's snoring. 8:30 standing, go to the shower, must take a positive attitude and forget that hot water should be optional! I swore to leave my opinion on the site, it is the flight is tired of paying for it to have. room 102 stay from 17 to 18 september

__label__strneg it is a trap that I do not recommend you to suffer 1. the elevator is on the 3rd floor the other feet even if you have a big suitcase 2 the television does not work 3 icing on the cake a ceaseless noise all night the engine of the elevator. and this for a 3 star at 120 € per night! bravo ! have a good word hello!

__label__strneg very good hotel, where the rooms are well decorated, there is also a very good restaurant integret at this hotel. the staff is very friendly and very kind.

__label__strneg this hotel has ruined my entire living room with a laptop; a sofa ; a fixed computer; Chair and ceiling as the hotel leaked water from one of their tubs and this water went through the ceiling and rotted the entire living room for 15 days as I was on vacation. (I live just below the hotel).

__label__strneg good hotel 2 steps from lyon station small room but very clean, the wifi worked well the staff is very helpful and informed us quot quot;

__label__strneg waitresses not nice, sandwich poorly done, order not respected, full bins ...

__label__strneg hotel convenient because close to the station of lyon. the rooms are small but clean and well insulated from the outside noise but not the noise inside. more light from the corridor is lit all night, which is seen through the door of the room. the breakfast room is too small and the service is slow. moreover it's not a buffet. short hotel correct for a short stay.

__label__strneg ch 51 75 € (out of season) value for money more than correct, new bathroom with large shower and separate toilet. the room is clean and bright. the staff is welcoming. only worries we hear a lot of noise from the corridor and the bathroom next door ... I recommend

__label__strneg very good hotel and great hospitality.

__label__strneg a hotel located next to the train station of lyon which is good when you have very heavy luggage! you can eat in the bastille (5 minutes walk) or there is a little all the restaurants and for all tastes! the location for breakfast deserves to be a little more spacious, because sometimes you have to wait in case of high attendance.

__label__strneg this hotel is brand new. the receptionist told me they had opened in 2012. the colors red and white are very pretty. the staff are helpful, they even offered me a coffee. I will return with my eyes closed!

__label__strneg a hotel where the men go to deceive their wives.

__label__strneg good memories in this menagerie.

__label__strneg I arrived January 1, 2009 in Paris at your hotel where I received room 156 a real cooler everything was cold in the room the dras dansle beds too. Before leaving the hotel for dinner we announced at the reception the case but the night we spent in a cold room we feel that the staff of the hotel was aware of this room and also the noise next to the lift and piping. Sunday, January 4 at breakfast at 9:30 there were more croissants nor Viennese to believe that the person in charge of the morning (lamb) does not have the responsibilities that one entrusts him no competence.

__label__strneg correct but narrow. difficult to get into the shower.

__label__strneg Very good value for money . Very nice home . very clean . to recommend .

__label__strneg this quot; hotel quot; had to be nice enough just after its construction, unfortunately it falls into ruin. my remarks relate to room 10 (I have not seen others) _it is stains on the carpet, on the walls, and under the mattress (I wished I had looked) _the window does not lock (it opens if you pull it, even when it is supposed to be locked) _a single power socket _big sealing problem in the shower on the wall that separates the bathroom from the bedroom, at the level of shower but room side, the wallpaper is peeling off and the wall is black mold. _the faucet of the bathroom sink does not correctly adjust the temperature of the water, so it's impossible to have only cold water _the support above the sink (to put the cup , the toothbrush, ...) comes off, it should not be long to fall - the bar fixed to the wall between the sink and the bathroom (to hang on a towel) also stands out - there are several large cigarette holes in the shower curtain _the showerhead is broken, the water fuse in two perpendicular directions _il is no more ceiling under the shower, so we can see that the real ceiling composed of crumbling concrete, and iron bars completely rusted. the _the sheets were clean _8 tv channels (tf1, fr2, fr3, fr5, frô, tmc, nrj12, lcp) _55 € for a room with private shower, 2min walk from the station of lyon, we can not say that it is expensive.

__label__strneg Really disappointed with this stay, I do not recommend this hotel. After persistent problems with the magnetic card, I was woken up in the middle of the night by the roommate which I felt he was going to get into my room because the walls were badly insulated. the staff was not very friendly or present and the facilities are a little outdated (including the elevator).

__label__strneg very mediocre reception, elevator down without staff explanation, noise infernal room overlooking the street, many problems with magnetization cards opening rooms and intrusion of person in the middle of the night in the room while we had a card passes room bath in bad condition and equipment (broken toilet bezel that we had to replace inadmissible!) only advantage close to a metro station high price compared to services

__label__strneg chgt of owners. the old bouiboui has become a brewery. Good place and what I ate there was good.

__label__strneg excellent brewery with fine and fresh products, with a very friendly service.

__label__strneg Friendly staff, except the manager. the manager is unfriendly to the possible, scornful and rude. he speaks very badly to his staff. the site forgets to indicate that customers can be changed places 3 times the buffet incomprehensibly.

__label__strneg problem of reservations not retained

__label__strneg good restaurant located near the metro. very fast service. very very beautiful orchid. good atmosphere, very nice server. we were offered sake with a little surprise at the bottom of the glass for men and women! !

__label__strneg Terrible bedding! 150 € to have the ratings bumped by the springs of a bed that had to know the war!

__label__strneg deco viellotte, stained carpet, wall sconce that quot; pend quot; dangerous! cupboard door not flowing; ; ; no hot water 'december'; independent of their will (problem on the network due to the snow: no compensation possible, barely courteous staff only positive point, quiet room, poorly done household very disappointed do not recommend ... ...

__label__strneg this hotel dates back to 1870 and is still owned by the same family. this hotel has no star because it does not want it. he prefers anonymity and cultivates anonymous hospitality. he is held by a superb girl who has a splendid son.

__label__strneg hotel located in a district to discover paris and near the station of lyon! very good hotel for a two star! to advise for cheap stopover in the capital!

__label__strneg Beautiful rooms, a newly refurbished hotel, everything was there for a good stay. Only downside, the breakfast was 100000 places of a Parisian breakfast ... no croissant. we had the right to bread and crackers, too bad ... the corner is very nice, no law bercy village and a metro train!

__label__strneg welcomes and very warm atmosphere, the service is fast however, their coffee is still a little elevated, the neighborhood remains charmingand sympathetic. ké coffee staff are awesome, it guides us to choose, and shares good delights

__label__strneg home more than mediocre, dirty room ...

__label__strneg there is a bedroom which is located on the ground floor behind the lobby. you have no privacy, the bathroom being adjoining. if it has been redone and great, we really hear everything, all the comings and goings during the night, it's a nightmare! moreover the hotel is under construction (January 2013), the reception is in a deplorable state. upstairs the rooms are tiny, and depending on what you book, you do not have bathroom or toilet.

__label__strneg warm welcome in this Thai spa that does not look from the outside. attentive masseuse, very attentive, intense relaxation. place to recommend.

__label__strneg 3 nights on site air-conditioned rooms, quiet (double windows). breakfast is quot; passable quot; (bad coffee) a good compromise nevertheless for a few days in Paris. take a walk through the small neighborhood behind the second street on the right, going right, to the poplar postern. dine next door at the right time, you will not regret it.

__label__strneg bedding in poor condition, the room is small, the staff is nonchalant and little involved (wait 20 minutes at breakfast for bread). the worst probably the hotel is dirty, the bathroom in the room and the pool area too! in short, I absolutely do not advise if the location is ideal

__label__strneg with my friend, we spent a week at this hotel due to very limited budget. the rooms are old and poorly decorated with carpet / wallpaper torn. you have to pay extra to use the shower down the hall. the reception is sometimes average. the cleaning is not very well done but the sheets are clean. the bedding is very bad, with spring beds that hurt your back. attention all week, we were devoured by parasites (bedbugs) that were likely in the mattress of the bed. In short, we were anxious to leave this hotel, which we do not recommend to spend more than a night or two.
