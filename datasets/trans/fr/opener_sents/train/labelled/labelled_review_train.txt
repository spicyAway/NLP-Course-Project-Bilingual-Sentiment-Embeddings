__label__neg I have never seen that in my life. the host insults a customer (because the guy at the reception is too drunk and frozen) and put his point in the face and leave to run after hitting him with a motorcycle helmet. worse as if it was not enough, put another couple out insulting. really .. think well before going to the - /
__label__neg do not go there! Staff not friendly. beware the wifi internet is paying, the information is omitted on their website. breakfast too expensive. moreover the photos of their site really give a false hope, the reality is much less advantageous. I do not remember being so disappointed. the rooms are tiny and very dark. the furniture has lived well. no elevator! noisy rooms! In short, a bitter taste after this stay and a feeling of being made. as far as going to a hotel in the outskirts of the city for this price, the benefits are better
__label__neg I had a competition in the same avenue, I could not have a quiet environment and the necessary access to carry my heavy luggage ... in fact, the hotel does not have shutters at the windows, no elevator, the condition of the rooms is more than mediocre and finally the acoustic insulation allowed me to hear the neighbors in the middle of the night ... in short, I do not recommend it.
__label__neg Return from a stay in Paris, hotel very welcoming, good staff and very friendly, well located and arrange with great taste.
__label__neg disastrous home, average room (mold, small bathtub with large traces of blackish limestone, toilet seat crooked, paint dripping on the tiling dirt, soap dish that is useless except to get hurt due to positioning, carpet with no and stained. I did a test over 3 days with a white wire that I had cut in half and highlighted on the ground ... they did not move the week. In short, out of the question for me to return. I do not advise or in desperation.
__label__neg very good hotel. Perfect location in Paris 5 minutes walk from the Place de Clichy. modern and clean room. the staff and very welcoming special mention for the head of reception carlo. to redo! !
__label__neg I take this hotel for 6 years to 15 times a year about week or we or 4/5 days in a row.

__label__neg very nice, I like to enjoy a hotel lobby clear and quiet. Nice rooms, a nice breakfast and only a five minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe! the receptionists are very friendly)
__label__neg lamentable value for money zero no hot water at 5pm to shower room with a smell of vagrant tobacco room dirty hole in the wall scratched paint ... ceiling of the entrance hidden by an old plywood plate. wc with unwinded paper broken sill threshold bar, crawl space in the bathroom not closed and infecte tt that for the incredible price of 380 euros per night ...
__label__neg very small bathroom room more than rusty trace of rust on the edge of the tub and at the bottom. does not deserve 3 stars. only one . the only positive side is that it is next to a metro station.
__label__neg Cardinal is a character belonging to the universe of marvel comics. he appeared for the first time in new warriors 28, in 1992. we do not know much about the life of the mercenary Joshua Clendenon. he is a former soldier who has a daughter named valérie, herself engaged in the marine. Clendenon was the leader of a mercenary squadron named Air Force. they faced the new warriors and were defeated.
__label__neg quiet and friendly hotel. the restaurant is not good the meat tastes like grilled, they have scallops for st jacques, the dessert is very average ... and finally, the service is expeditious. so to avoid.
__label__neg hotel that deserves to be known. small hotel warm and peaceful. helpful and smiling staff. to recommend !
__label__neg not very smiling, small breakfast with coffee not very good and expired orange juice, no buffet as he says, tiny elevator that hangs often, room and bathroom very small (just fine for spend the nights there and still we sleep very badly), dubious tasks on the cushions
__label__neg to flee, I have never seen a hotel so old, and no longer in the current standards, certainly there is no star.a sinister room in the 4th without elevator no network to receive calls there to emit, we can not even have reception! .a toilet on the landing, no soundproofing, window that gives in a courtyard like tube 2 m wide. a mattress of another age ... and the height! a breakfast charged 9 euros with 2 toasts already buttered, a half kiwi 3 cartier clementine, 3 small pancakes and a bowl of black coffee ... a scandal! .total of the palace 72 euros.bref I did not sleep of the night the various noises frololage and others ...
__label__neg in fact it's way less! the decor is so dated that even my great grandmother had to have contemporary wallpaper! the bathroom deserves a serious blow of cillit bang to remove the musty (as old as the fresh) shower head without the pear, his come back to wash the tuyo! wc on the landing (it's already average) but in addition the door does not close, and the width of the toilet does not remove the 70 cm, (basically it is usable until 12 years later must be contorssionist! and to finish the closing hours of the hotel the night contrain returned before 23:30, as well say that amp; If the subway times in Paris are better not to have planned to go out late or far! Fortunately, all these small successes are largely compensated by the quality of the service and the welcome ainci that the kindness of the manager! basically some small jobs inexpensive to do (anti limestone product and anti mold, paint,) and a little maintenance of the equipment to control, and it can easily be spent from the average hotel less to the hotel more cheap and quality!
__label__neg I went several times during my Paris break, dine at this well located property. the reception is very friendly; the staff is dynamic, helpful. it's nice to feel that because it's becoming more and more rare. eating at night on the terrace is a pure treat. the contents of the plates are just as rich and very good from the entrance to the desserts. I will continue to spend some good moments in this establishment during my next trips in a charming place
__label__neg it is in the heart of montmarte and pigalle that has just opened the hotel josephine, the youngest member of the paris-hotel group's family. reminiscent of the roaring twenties, its decor is inspired by the sets of cabarets of the time of our dear josephine baker a "red mill" atmosphere but with modern accents. at a time when the old nasty temples of the rue pigalle, frochot and victor massé settle, and where the "bars with whores" close one after the other in favor of new bars "bobos" (coffee carmen, at moune, r-pigalle, the carefree, mansart, glass ...), this hotel seems to want to keep the vintage spirit of the neighborhood, and add a touch of modernity. this is the spirit of the new bobo district so-pi (ny inspired appellation for "south pigalle"). this small hotel (41 rooms) with decoration inspired by the world of the dance and the night, takes backstage appearances of the madnesses shepherdesses. frilly in plumage, this small discreet hotel will be perfect to travel out of time and join the world of this dear josephine baker.
__label__neg Do not be fooled by the wall carpet in the lobby of this new hotel. the real discoveries are made in rooms with sparkling and charming colors. big favorite for the retro fixtures in the devil and the room on the top floor, under the beams with a small private balcony for a romantic and intimate breakfast overlooking the rooftops of Paris.
__label__neg the orange color is not your best ally so close your eyes when you enter the elevator. the shock can be intense for the most sensitive. here, the trip is in the spotlight and is discovered by keys through the exotic rooms and classes. it's very cocooning and exotic. only one question why one does not understand the presence of a small eyecup installed on each bathroom door.
__label__neg unbelievable ! ... we are received no matter how. We ask for a coffee at their bar and he asks us to leave unless we take a room! no politeness ... just amazing!
__label__neg an awesome hotel close to the train station and a stone's throw from the casino de paris the rooms are clean the service is nice really a great time to spend there!
__label__neg very innovative concept, the hotel love is an exceptional place where one comes to two or between friends spend a nice time in a hushed and intimate atmosphere. the card is correct and we eat pretty well. to do at least once to test a mood quot; different quot; .
__label__neg arrived at the hotel, the reception is mediocre, the receptionist (we seem to annoy) barely said hello and gives us quickly the number of the floor and our room. the room is ok but we have separate beds oo. it looks clean but the 2nd day, we notice some kinds of chips jump in the bathtub gt; Finally, the price of breakfast is excessive (12 euros per person)!
__label__neg positive well located, nice home, good soundproofing compared to the street. 24h reception. negative. small rooms, no drawers for storing business. no electrical outlets I had to unplug the TV to be able to charge the laptop. . no phone usage or drinks at the mini bar. . lift down for 3 days. phone calls without anyone answering in the middle of the night. . clerks who demand when the room is busy in the morning and leave clean towels on the floor in the hallway.
__label__neg I took this hotel by default and did not find another hotel with a reasonable price. nothing fancy for this hotel. the rooms are clean and the staff welcoming. no sound problems vis-à-vis the street. the insulation of the rooms is to be reviewed against vis-à-vis the interior.
__label__neg very good hotel, clean and tidy. to recommend !
__label__neg this magic hotel is really very beautiful and very well placed because it is on the most beautiful avenue in the world here is why if you want to spend a night of wake up on the most beautiful avenue in the world it's the place to go you do not would not be disappointed do not worry
__label__neg ... I was advised in mid-December 2012 as a good hotel, but I found myself in an old room, old-fashioned, stale in a room from 380euro per night and 3 people (2 adults of medium size and a girl of 11 years) you could not turn so much was reduced, bathroom with molds at the angles and shower siphon that leaked and splashed everywhere, breakfast too expensive for what was offered and finally kept 75 euros for 1 hour of delay in leaving the room (they want 100 euro deposit as soon as you arrive for any extra consumption) .... considering that, of course, it was not full and justly sparsely occupied! if you want a treatment quot; robbery quot; it's the right place! ... I was in mid-December 2012 recommended as a good standard hotel, instead I ended up in a local, old, old-fashioned, stuck in a room € 380 per night and 3 (2 adults average body build) and a 11 year old girl) you can not turn so she was small, bathroom with shower mold at the corners and siphon leaks and squirts everywhere, breakfast too expensive for what was offered and finally detained € 75 for 1 hour of late to leave the room (they want € 100 deposit on arrival for all drinks extra) .... considered, of course, was not complete and badly occupied! if you want a real treat flight quot; is the place!
__label__neg the hotel is well placed but prices too high regarding the value for money. the walls are so thin that we could hear the different conversations of our neighbors, the room well, although clean was not in an exceptional general condition and we did not have a shower curtain. when we needed an iron, we had an old one with the cord was damaged and of course the board was optional given and my friend had to iron his shirt on the floor .. Breakfast is not included in the 220 euros per night which is very disappointing ... the service was ok even if a bit overrated. I will not say it was the worst experience of my life, but neither was it by far the best!
__label__neg good italian restaurant although that reputation of best Italian of the district is exaggerated, average service
__label__neg old cultural place where all the Parisian press came to be found in a bubbling of ideas and debates, today this place has given way to a very luxurious cold and soulless hotel, which is besides in receivership since february 2013 . to believe that the way the owners are quot; disposed of; all the former staff of the press club de france did not bring them happiness ... ....
__label__neg very nice address for this small hotel which opened in September a very warm decoration, and charming and comfortable rooms, the staff is welcoming and friendly, the decoration is signed jacques garcia, to recommend
__label__neg Excellent hotel overall. I spent a week on Paris, and I stayed in this hotel for the duration of my stay. we had, me and my companion, a very beautiful room with a very original decoration. it was clean with nice furniture typical of Paris. Basically, if I chose this hotel, it was especially for its very privileged location, I absolutely wanted it to be close to the fields elysées, and it turns out that this hotel is 5 minutes walk from the superb avenue. In addition, it is 10 minutes from the Eiffel Tower taking the subway. the price of the room also motivated me, considering the location is not expensive at all, and for that, I must say that it is a very good value for money. I do not forget to greet the staff. they were all very professional, and were always available and smiling to inform us about the monuments and the hippest corners of Paris. voila ! I took the time to write this message to advise without reservation this hotel which left me a very good impression.
__label__neg very well placed. we stayed one night on the top floor, courtyard view (very quiet indeed). the walls are not very thick, we hear the neighbors easily (not until the snoring ^^). room of correct size. attic. very hard mattress. flat screen tv. shower wc. common areas in average condition. breakfast orange juice, tea / coffee / chocolate, bread + pastry + toast, jam / butter, plain yoghurt. in summary good value for money given the location of the hotel.
__label__neg A very good value for money . a nice deco and a warm welcome close to major department stores and major monuments. I will come back without hesitation
__label__neg hotel very well located, almost at the corner of boulevard haussman, a few steps from department stores and the opera garnier. there is a bus stop in front of the hotel and a metro station within a minute walk. ideal to discover Paris. very nice home. there is always someone at the reception (day or night). comfortable rooms. I will return without problem. the elevator is worth a look!
__label__neg very good location. near downtown. positive and welcoming team. clean hotel. good quality rooms and the bathroom with a bathtub (which becomes rare in Paris). I recommend . Only downside no parking, in this area is a problem. but if you come by train or plane I recommend it. basically only good associations with this hotel.
__label__neg the garden is just beautiful! the greenery is very well maintained and you have lots of shadows with benches to ask you quiet! Family picnics are nice to do there!
__label__neg weird booking policy they only take reservations if you stay more than 2 nights ( ( ... never seen such ridiculous policy in any decent hotel around . it is pretty wierd as the hotel has nothing special , and a rather unfriendly staff . you feel like you are not welcome . so , if as a client you are not wanted ... my suggestion is go elsewhere . for the French choose another hotel. they do not take reservations for less than two nights and apparently (see other reviews), do not refund if you interrupt your stay. apart from this quasi-racket policy, the hotel is nothing great ... so go your way.
__label__neg when we arrived, our booking was not taken into account while I had a confirmation email of the hotel! the hotel was full so impossible to find us a room! lack of professionalism in this case. they offered to find another hotel but after 10 phone calls, all the hotels were full, the 11th was the right one (at the other end of the city) but without knowing where we would set foot (all Complete hotels except this one does not bode well for good quality), so we decided to shorten our stay. 1 day rotten in Paris instead of a good weekend ... .. we will return (in Paris) but certainly not bac st hermain! !
__label__neg hotel very pleasant, many characters, a little expensive but without regret. well located . no complaints ! if you are looking for a small nest socket, you make the right choice.
__label__neg Belle Epoque hotel ... highly recommended. after our second stay at Easter ... hat. the interior of the rooms are very authentic. warm atmosphere even in winter. we feel a little bourgoise "because if the balconies are open (and it was until late at night and so the night so) the heart and soul of the Latin Quarter or the 'roaring 20' could be really felt ) ... room service and very often changed linné). we will be coming soon for third time to summer ... first time visited december 26, 2012 until january, 6 very romantic. with near advised of saint germain of meadows, our-lady, the seine incredible to see a balcone. saxophone songs in the evening (19-21 clock) and Sunday morning. very neat interior of the room and bathroom. we were 11 days and nights between 2012 and 2013 and slept with open balconies ... dream for university students (near the sorbonne, faculty of medicine) ... we will keep coming back to this place and feel at home and never forget the first time my little trianon ... kisses mom with my daughter ...
__label__neg how to say ... if you are visiting Paris for one night and you are not, but then not at all demanding and you have balls quiets, I think this hotel is for you) otherwise, too hot with non-adjustable heating. in terms of smell, I felt like staying in a home for the elderly. a lot of noise in the night with cracking floor, possibility of listening to the jokes of the next room, noisy stairs, staff very smiling and love to answer your questions ... no I'm kidding! short hotel to take only for a room below 60 euros
__label__neg unhygienic, showers full of grime, the bed and room room, a drain pipe passes into the room and makes a deafening noise with each use (full night included) short hotel to avoid at all costs for the same price there has a lot better!
__label__neg hotel booked and paid for 3 weeks, arrival at 10:30 and no room, not a word of excuse, sends us to his boyfriend! 1h30 lost to find another room, other tourists were in the same case as us. Says on the phone that all rooms have en-suite bathrooms and showers are in the hallway! !
__label__neg Friendly hotel is clean. no air conditioning and garage, but there is a vinci garage next door. very correct summarizes for a hotel at the Porte de Paris
__label__neg hotel to avoid 1. the hotel Havana is officially a 3 star it does not deserve it! cramped corridors, rooms small and in poor condition (the bathroom door was literally gnawed with moisture, the wallpaper faded and glued with tape, the TV remote failed, the hair dryer down,. ..), totally insufficient breakfasts both in choice and quality, ... 2. very noisy, both internally (everything sounds from room to room, from floor to floor) and outside (there are night cafes and 2 parkings for motorbikes in the street) we spent 2 sleepless nights (our 9 year old son cried in despair in the middle of the night to not be able to sleep) and our stay suffered greatly (visit the big kandinsky exhibition without having slept what a mess! ... )
__label__neg the room, redone recently (the only positive point), stinks of the smell of sewer in the bathroom (on the 6th floor, a roof). the air conditioning does not work worse, it blows hot, by 32 ° C outside (even when stopped). a real oven. the room offers a poor garden chair in scrap and wood, more than uncomfortable. assured style, as much as discomfort. the rooms overlooking the courtyard on the top floors, receive all the noise and smell of extractors of the restaurants of the ground floor, launched at full speed during the service. (and considering the heat, impossible to close the windows) especially not to arrive during the night watchman's watch. little eager, grumpy, and understandable limit, and royally ignoring customer satisfaction. an execrable price / quality ratio. in short, to flee urgently
__label__neg 399 rue des pyrenées is to flee a grimy hotel even my dog ​​does not deserve a place like this ... ..! pity that I can not add photos flee escape .... ! !
__label__neg we booked this hotel as well located and economical. very warm welcome and Rachel always ready to help you in your restaurant choices. quiet room . nice decoration. free wifi access! tea available after a day of sightseeing. really a very good choice.
__label__neg I used this hotel as part of a business trip. everything is in standard, reception, comfort of the room neither more nor less. asset good geographical location.
__label__neg 1 good hotel good side, quiet location, perfect reception service, perfect room (feather room), easy access near the north station and metro, rich breakfast buffet, good extra (coffee machine in the room internet free at the reception iphone alarm clock in the room), keeps luggage at the reception on the last day. 2- Negative side breakfast on Sunday morning (03-11-2013), the preposer was a little over (slow) for the reassortment of the buffet, missing a wardrobe in the room or storage area.
__label__neg it's really worth it. the hotel has an indescribable charm, which begins with the flowers covered by its facade. each room is unique. the people are really nice. when we leave, he leaves us the desire to return immediately.
__label__neg very friendly neighborhood bar and friendly clientele. the prices are quite low and the choice varied. I recommend the beer and mojitos.
__label__neg unforgettable stay from 11 to 18 august a district to visit a hotel of charm modern and authentic very nice the gym followed by a hammam, to finish in the living room to drink champagne between beams nd era and stone walls of personal bets available warm welcome continental breakfast hearty (beware if you are on the diet baked cakes on the spot they are formidable) to advise!
__label__neg reservation problem at the arrival of the hotel we had specified (the day before and at the time of booking) that a baby was present and we bring an umbrella bed. the person at the reception did not know what to do, because usually the bed is provided (and of course charged extra!) . no ability to adapt, problems also to express themselves. In addition, we had booked 2 rooms including a quot; twins quot; with 2 separate beds; we had 2 double rooms ... the condition of the rooms was acceptable, but the kettle and cups above the mini-fridge were dirty, there were traces of cake on the rim of the cups as well as the tea or dried coffee on the tray. Then the tiny bathroom could touch the sink, shower and toilet at the same time. badly placed lights, the shower was very dark, and the shower door squeaked. if not for the few positives the wifi, the view (6th floor), overall price, and location.
__label__neg small friendly hotel, very well located next to the metro, express crossroads, brewery quot; to the subway quot; (They serve very good salads!) Japanese / Asian restaurant. small room but sufficient for short stay, rather nice staff, can be a bit too quot; familiar quot; . a hotel with good value for my taste.
__label__neg calm attention but not totally! I read some reviews that say it's quiet but beware! the street is quiet but the hotel less. In the room where we were overlooking the Rue de Malte, we heard the metro and felt the vibrations of it every five minutes. moreover the insulation between the rooms is rather bad, we heard the toilets of the room next door as well as the movements of the people etc ... that did not disturb us because with the fatigue, no difficulty to sleep but some may not live it the same way as us. cleanliness of the room nothing to say, more rooms seem to have been renovated a short time ago so pleasantly surprised at the opening of the room. there is wi-fi, for my part I was on the first floor, it worked pretty well except for a few cuts. the staff was pleasant, we responded easily to our requests even at late hours. regarding breakfast, to avoid. the price is excessive. a little tip, there is a bakery around the corner, a croissant with a coffee and you come out for a lot less money.
__label__neg I arrive at the hotel, they give me my key, my room was on the 5th floor, guess! no assenter! broken down, I ask how long, I've been told for quite a few days. I asked why is it not mentioned on the site I'm told it's the boss who did not do it. I climb the 5 floors, I immediately try to connect to work on my computer, it takes a code for my internet connection, until normal! I dial 9 for the reception, I am confirmed that the hotel has no internet connection! I am even more frightened! I still note that when I booked by internet it is a criterion that I asked and it is mentioned that your hotel has a connection! the answer given to me, the same quot; it is the director who does not want to remove this mention quot; . I am kindly proposed to go to a bar where a connection is possible if not to work with an unsecured connection. third episode so I decided to take a shower, I open the bathroom door, already very small, but believe me I was but out of me! mold on the walls, black tiles at the joints. Since how long this hotel has not been visited by the health service someone does their job how can you still rent this room the soundproofing even worse! the evacuations of water that we hear in continuous, the curtains rooms, old washbasin that flees .. I paid for a service that in my opinion is a lie and more that is not worth the price. good luck to follow them!
__label__neg by or to begin ... non-existent reception, the guy at the reception gave me my key and he did not go to do something else ... he was not interested to know if I was a tourist or other, if I was going to need wifi or if it interested me to know what time I could take my breakfast; continental quot; the morning that was included in my reservation! I will return to this breakfast further afield ... the elevator is scary (moves strange) and there is no indication of the maximum weight supported or the date of the last technical control. the state of the corridor is dilapidated, just like the rooms! litrie dates from the 30s, the floor is dusty, the windows are single glazed (in the city!) . my room was on the 5th floor and the ceiling on this floor does not exceed 1m95, tall person or clostro abstain! the bathroom is a real disaster! no plastic bag in the trash (visible trace of the last tenant .. yuck) the glass is a classic glass (usually a plastic glass under plastic), thank you hygiene! the bath is a little elevated so we still catch the ceiling which is already very low! and it is full of mold over the bath ... same for the shower curtain! once on 2 the toilets make an insisportable hissing sound. the pear shower has no support and elongated max I just over my head (I'm 1m70 ....) . I will finish with the continental breakfast ... the most rikiki that I was given to see! 1 croissant, a piece of bread a coffee, a chocolate or a tea ... that's all! no orange juice no milk roll no cereal, no fruit! and the desu on does not tighten all alone, no question of going to look for a croissant because the lady left after 5 min is never seen again. have a good word ...
__label__neg apart from the location which is in the center of Paris so well located the rest leaves a desire. poorly soundproofed room. stained carpet. bathroom very small and dirty. Very high price for the quality of this hotel. I do not recommend
__label__neg small hotel very good value for money! ideal for a weekend or short break to visit the capital on a budget. very well located in the center of paris near the tourist places. close to metros oberkampf and republic. hotel 2 stars cheap, the staff is easily reachable by mail or phone, once there they are quite cold but available. 3 days in this hotel on the 2nd floor with elevator, in a small room completely redone! it was a very good surprise! the view of the courtyard is not terrible but at least it is quiet! the bathroom is totally new and very well equipped! sound insulation is a weak point ... many door noise. but at that price I really recommend this hotel for a quick getaway in the capital without breaking the bank)
__label__neg the general hotel said "I invite you to my neighborhood". the call was answered. we spent the night there. go to the hotel in his own city, the feeling is delicious, strange, exciting. we disembark around 22h. good reception of the receptionist who lets us go alone in our room. it is composed of a small room with a small adjoining lounge separated by a corridor where are embedded two sinks, the bath giving in the room. the space is optimized to the maximum. the decor is rather nice and good taste, but with some problems of finishes. poorly thought out handles, paint overflowing with complaints. we probably quibble but at 300 € the room we did not pay, we allow ourselves. here are the flats. for the rest a perfect night. with the preliminaries (the apple on the pillow and the bathrobe on the bed), good bedding and especially no noise because the room overlooks a surprisingly quiet courtyard for the neighborhood. the general is campaigning! but the best of the best is breakfast. the buffet is excellent, the food varied, the fresh products and quite worthy of the stars of the 4 * of the general. the space is very nice and the service impeccable. Oh I was going to forget, there is a fitness center but was exceptionally closed during our stay.
__label__neg small hotel very well located 300m from the parmentier metro. It does not look like it is clean, affordable and the owners are friendly. on the other hand, the old construction causes bad sound insulation at the doors of the rooms and one can be disturbed by what happens in the stairwell. in short a good address to recommend (light sleep to abstain) ps a very good Indian restaurant is located a few streets further up republic.
__label__neg the room itself is ok (comfy bed, shower and toilet ok), but needs a good clean up; in the same way, Ikea furniture needs to be renewed. during our stay, neither sheets nor towels were changed. the breakfast is too expensive for 7 euros for a half baguette, a croissant, a hot drink, a juice, a portion of butter and jam. the hotel is 2 minutes from the metro station pelleport, very convenient. the staff is friendly
__label__neg to avoid . I strongly recommend it for a 2 star hotel is extremely expensive 88 euros for a triple room, on everything with the reception staff who do not even answer your hello. the state of rooms let hope better decoration hyper outdated no phone, no remote control. very noisy insulation nonexistent. I went there with my friends for the period from May 19 to May 22, 2009. At the end of our stay, we wanted extended and for that I asked the watchman to book again for 4 nights. Next morning, the receptionist refused to change the room (as it was very small for three people, and is located above a bar), and even threatened to cancel the reservation, if we do not pay the totality the bill for the coming days (he wanted to have money for the service not provided!) , by not being satisfied with the loans of blue card which he had on his hands for three days. we were very surprised, he wanted to physically threaten me out of the reception. I wanted to call the police, but since we had a scheduled appointment, I dropped. now, as I am free I decided to warn other potential customers and especially the management of the hotel.
__label__neg bad experience if you go in the winter (and in summer I do not know lol), because the shower is in the hallway and you risk a cold. the building is old, dirty and unhealthy, no renovation in years. I advise him to make a visit from the head of the tourist office in Paris and put the points on the i to the Chinese manager, he is a bit rude and has little preocupe for its customers ...
__label__neg After a reservation by phone 48 hours in advance, I had to change my stay in Paris. the reception confirmed my reservation without telling me that it was not cancellable less than 48 hours in advance while I was paying the normal price. when I called 2 hours later when I received the confirmation email, they did not want to know anything about the fact that the general conditions of sale were listed on their website. and that he will recontact me if they can not re-let the room. of course this was not the case (but no way to validate that of course). it is always unpleasant to see after the fact that we got stuck in a trap. Even if the hotel is well located, the finishes are not at the rendezvous (during my previous stays in this hotel) and especially in the bathroom. and to top it all they promised me to send me the bill and I've been waiting for it for over a month! no long term vision no customer satisfaction management and they prefer to earn cash, even if it is worth a negative opinion on google
__label__neg the staff is friendly but nothing more. in any case it is very good for a school trip. the breakfast is very good but the lunch and dinner less, but hey, it's very convenient anyway, right in the center.
__label__neg I spent 3 days in mije with class friends. the rooms are very nice, clean and pretty well insulated from the outside noise. there are the w.c. and the showers in the rooms, very good. the meals are very good, no worries to get over it; ) We really enjoyed this hostel, I recommend it! !
__label__neg This is really the worst hotel I have ever been to arriving from a particular room of reservation. 1st room offered stinks of painting 2nd room quot; it remains that ca quot; it was lamentable no catch except that of the TV which was not present in the passage, no cover the window does not close at once you quail all night and you are awakened by the pigeons in short a room well dilapidated no more toilet No shower on the floor ca did not even a 30 euros .... unhelpful staff ... .and I could still add ... .. I do not recommend it absolutely ...
__label__neg the premises downstairs so home, refectory, bar, computer room are very beautiful, and well maintained but for what is the rest, it leaves seriously desired, the room is disgusting I ended up with a drunk guy and violent for a bed story while he had not booked, which forced me to bring in the security guard if I wanted to sleep peacefully. the rooms are not accessible from noon to 4 pm so the flights are limited but for those who wish to rest then it is not possible. for that is the breakfast that went little but I strongly advise to buy ate at the small store which is located 2 steps from the hostel because the meal rates are exorbitant. the hostel does not take checks
__label__neg hi matic, everything is automatic but above all everything is very intuitive here no incomprehensible technology. we just have to let ourselves be guided. Anyway, there is always someone to help you if needed or give you good local addresses. the room is playful, original and depaysante. I particularly love the mattress in shape memory. I recommend to anyone who wants to discover Paris differently
__label__neg 4 nights spent at this hotel in June 2013. very good establishment, the premises are pleasant and in good condition. bright room with a big television. only negative, the street is quite noisy, almost crippling to open the window (there is however a small balcony). the room is made daily. the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. the hotel has a very nice flowery courtyard and the breakfast that can be had is quite good but lacks a bit of variety.
__label__pos superb place and class for a unique declaration of love ... the bar is fantastic

__label__pos very nice hotel the suites are a bit small but great in terms of class and comfort seen eiffel tower with small balcony very appreciated the service is impeccable
__label__pos frankly I made a stay of 3 nights and following the different opinion read and seen on the internet I asked questions about the quality of service and maintenance but I went because the reservation on the internet was made and then pay quot; to god va quot; friendly single room with double bed, shower, TV (flat screen), sink 4th floor without elevator and toilet on landing the paintings are faded. after inspection of the room it is clean and no small animals on the horizon lack the neon above the sink (supplied and go up by the home) the shower mixer is blocked on hot so to overcome this failure to reduce on general power supplies in hot and cold to have an acceptable temperature. the carpet is faded but without particular odors the cover lived but it is hot then no need table, chair and TV with correct remote control. the stay the neighbors are quiet and without problems especially the reception is friendly and helpful the housekeeping is correct and every day the heat of more than 30 ° we made the nights were not very relaxing the shower was there to refresh us. conclusion the reception and daily maintenance is correct there is a serious brushstroke to renovate the walls and carpets the plumbing maintenance is poor the neighborhood is lively and offers plenty of opportunities for restoration and restoration. shopping without being a trap for tourists (real people in a real neighborhood paris) so I do not regret staying and given the price, do not expect to have the comfort of a two-star. good stay to you and that small comment flash.
__label__pos hotel located in a quiet street, clean rooms, very friendly staff, free wifi with excellent reception signal. if you are passing through paris I recommend this establishment.

__label__pos Quiet hotel and very pleasant. Price a bit high
__label__pos beautiful building art nouveau signed Jules Lavirotte. although it is impossible to realize, this building was made of reinforced concrete. but the facade is entirely covered with vegetal sandstone motifs (Alexandrist bigot ceramist). these patterns are typical of the art nouveau movement.
__label__pos wonderful hotel with beautiful rooms and meals! it was very very very comfortable and I recommend it to everyone. I intend to return myself. it was also very easy to find.
__label__pos Amazing, one of the only hotels in the world or if you want to change your reservation a week before your arrival date you are charged for your stay two nights result 638 euros for one person, breakfast not included while he had is paid in advance! in addition to that, infernal heat in the rooms in winter, so impossible to sleep! look elsewhere, the area is full of hotels and there is necessarily better, cheaper! the director does not need any customers anyway since he makes no concessions! !
__label__pos quiet and pleasant hotel. it is good value for money. the staff is smiling.
__label__pos A small boutique hotel located steps away, the reception is welcoming and the rooms are quiet and well equipped. free wifi, breakfast buffet and internet station available. Superior star rooms are spacious and can be family (surcharge), 2 minutes from the convention center, a good address!
__label__pos good hotel clean air-conditioned rooms the tele is just too small is a pity the beds very very comfortable but the spring creaks and it's a shame, the staff is very spicy the prices are affordable brief I spent an excellent stay! !
__label__pos modern 50 years ago, maybe ... traveling for work, I was very very disappointed ... half-dilapidated room, hygiene of dubious toilets, no plug in the bathroom ( practical to shave with the electric ...), the wifi is paying, the tv is noisy, small bed, the list is long ... easy to find better for the same price in the same neighborhood, so the argument of proximity does not hold. in summary, to avoid ...
__label__pos simply exceptional! a welcome at the top, with the presentation of the hotel and its history until the accompaniment in the room. our room was magical (opera garnier) with all the comfort you could ask for. a true paradise on paris. when at breakfast, excellent, with choice and quality products! the hotel had also recommended a nearby restaurant that was just as exceptional, quot; the percolator quot; .
__label__pos very clean hotel with great hospitality. the breakfast is full and varied and the breakfast room is beautiful. the rooms are comfortable and the bedding exceptional. good address to recommend!
__label__pos We came here with my wife for a weekend in Paris. we were not disappointed the room was nice, bright and quiet. The hotel staff was welcoming and was able to advise us for visits, restaurants ... I recommend
__label__pos a little better than the hotel in the same street, but for 80 euros the first night and 110 euros the next; we can find much better in the area, hotel not very well soundproofed because of the addition of rooms on each floor, with tiny bathroom, correct staff with very hearty breakfast for 9 euros the mention good, the rest banal for a total 208 euros is high.
__label__pos very nice hotel clean room nice staff i had a very good 5 night stay
__label__pos perfect, very welcome from a lovely receptionist, the rooms are very comfortable and the staff very nice, in a mythical area right in front of the red mill
__label__pos I go there often with colleagues / friends / family at noon it's really nice, atmosphere and very pleasant service. quality products, meat fish cheese ... etc. very good value for money, but avoid the evening because too many people or arrive tot).
__label__pos not much interest in this cafe, otherwise to have a large bay window, overlooking the street Mansart. the decor is not new, and the rest (conso) is very ordinary. apparently, it's mostly a venue for youth quot; connected quot; from the neighborhood . if you are not, you will not stay there longer than your consumption will last, the time to see all these young people snapping a kiss with a demonstrative enthusiasm, that you will not share ...
__label__pos very nice hotel with excellent value for money. the hotel has a beautiful entrance with a beautiful bar. the club room is spacious and has a small seating area with a sofa and a table, so we can receive friends quietly, the decor is chic and relaxing, very comfortable beds, a modern bathroom with outlets bathroom (very rare on paris except 5 stars) .ma room overlooked the inner court so that I enjoyed a total silence for my morning graces. the service is ok but lacks a little heat, 2nd bad point the maids open the door even if it was indicated not to disturb, and if it is not that, you wake up with a call from the reception ... to correct! very good rental of the hotel which is 20seconde of the station Europe and 8min walk galleries lafayettes!
__label__pos great location, very clean, very decent breakfast buffet and super friendly staff. during a stay of 3 nights (booked in double room), we asked to be able to change rooms after the first night for a room with twin beds, and although the hotel is full, it was done in 30 minutes . and we received a triple room at no extra cost. hat! should I say 'to recommend'
__label__pos the home is very nice, with directly at the entrance of the banquettes that are dreaming, the door is clean in the rooms the beds are comfortable enough, the bathroom is quite roomy, the only inconvienent is that some shutters are broken in any case in room 287
__label__pos nice hotel, recent renovation, very good service. only negative point the soundproofing.
__label__pos disappointed for the price. the elevator is very small with very strange noises. On the room side we had the right to a very small double room with stained linens and carpet. very small bathroom with toilet just outside the door where it is very difficult to sit upright, the shower seals are hs and the pressure is almost zero. the tv is very small flat screen and very poorly located compared to the bed against many TNT and HD channel. missing bulbs or hs in the room. the room is equipped with a mirror and safe. we slept badly because we were awakened around 5am by a neighbor talking in the hallway. hearty breakfast despite a problem with the hot drink machine.
__label__pos the hotel is beautiful and clean! the staff are welcoming and smiling. room 213, I am satisfied. it is true that the floor of the rooms crack a little, it's a bit embarrassing especially for others ... my room was overlooking the street lafferière, it was very quiet and appreciable. metro steps away!
__label__pos the hotel is new and very clean, the beds are very comfortable, the staff welcoming and accommodating. our room (one of the smallest in the hotel certainly) was a little tight but had a large closet for storing clothes and suitcases. so just to spend the weekend it was more than enough. the soundproofing is good between the rooms, the street is not too busy and double glazing is effective. the air conditioning works well and is silent. Decoration level, our room was of a modern and sober style. In short, my partner and I keep a good memory of this hotel.
__label__pos I stayed a few days in this small hotel in the Rue des Martyrs in the heart of Paris and I was very satisfied. the rooms are clean and well furnished, the welcome is warm. the hotel is perfectly located between montmarte and opera. a great stay that I'm not ready to forget.
__label__pos Congratulations for its original dishes and the design quite fascinating! we really want to extend our lunch on site, so we feel good ... continue well!
__label__pos excellent hotel. very design, elegant, comfortable. very friendly welcome.
__label__pos I have a bad memory there. being younger, one refuses to serve a waterworm to a friend of mine. aside from this non-trivial negative point it is indeed a beautiful place, where one is at your care. yet I do not think it's worth the price.
__label__pos this hotel is ideally located since it is on the Champs Elysées. the view is superb and the service is impeccable. the meals are also of high quality and the breakfast is more than satisfactory. I recommend this hotel for a stay in Paris.
__label__pos impeccable service and spacious rooms. Nothing to say in the course of work, not against a bit expensive for a private trip.
__label__pos The setting of this hotel is nice, and the welcome was rather warm when I arrived. breakfast . is ok without more. on the other hand, I had to take a cold shower the morning of my departure, the boiler having broken down. I had no excuse and even less commercial gesture for this technical incident. it is generally in the exceptions that we can judge the qualities of a performance, on this one I was very disappointed, so I would put a note lower than average.
__label__pos very beautiful architesture modernize by a soupsons of renaissance agremente a amenity of the personel and the whole covered with a royal comfort, the search for the decor is purified, refreshed but the flat are the ratio quality price in spite of the beauty of the place
__label__pos Often on a business trip in Paris, I tested the aparthotel paris formula, with some reluctance .... I was conquered! these serviced apartments paris as they are called in britain are extraordinary, very modern, in immaculate condition, extremely well equipped. The Madeleine Opera location was perfect for my travels, very central, metro at 100m. the services are amazing (free phone I liked a lot), many more than elsewhere, and the reception is very warm and professional. the bed, nothing to say perfect! better than many hotels 4 or 5! I will come back and recommend you without moderation! jean-paul, from lyon (france)
__label__pos located one hundred meters from Vendome Square in the middle of the street of peace. this show has received the palace label recently. an unusual architecture, a sensational decoration make this address one of the most beautiful hotel in paris.
__label__pos beautiful little hotel in the middle of the quot; golden triangle quot; . recently restored hotel, very elegant and refined. the rooms offer a great comfort. we are rather in a standard **** than ***. good compromise quality / price / situation for my appointments on paris.
__label__pos Arriving at the end of the evening of New Year, the receptionist was very courteous and we kindly outclassed in a double room called "quot; deluxe quot; . In fact we were treated to a brand new room with modern and quiet decor (in addition to double glazing) with a large shower and a huge flat screen TV, ideal for watching movies. Free wifi allowed us to surf to find a good restaurant but the receptionist helped us a lot too. we especially loved the breakfast buffet which is very hearty with a large selection of hot drinks (teas, coffee, chocolate ...) and fresh pastries and the possibility of leaving our luggage at the reception to enjoy our day in Paris. Without any hesitation, we will return with great pleasure! !
__label__pos a contemporary decor, a warm and professional welcome, the must-have cocktail bar that can create it with the help of bartender or even passing alone behind the bar a big thank you to jocelin, the bartender, for his master yoda. to do absolutely.
__label__pos tiny room without decoration, not at all like what is presented on their website. old furniture, ugly and damaged. only 8 TV sets, including 2-3 in French. 2 small single beds. room overlooking the flowerbed where everyone passes and therefore very noisy. no ventilation in the room forced to open the window, overlooking the lawn, to get the moisture out of the shower. no privacy. on the other hand, close to everything and clean.
__label__pos very nice hotel, super friendly staff. I keep an excellent memory of my stay. only negative point was the lunch.
__label__pos sheets too short for the bed, so that the feet and calves are directly on the mattress! the room was left wide open after cleaning with all our luggage inside including our laptop on the table and no service woman in the area! a shabby bed top and dubious cleanliness! at the reception when you point out these inconveniences, we retort that it is only a 2 stars (at 150 euros per night we can still expect better, no) a single positive point, the proximity of the Eiffel Tower, but there are other hotels much better at the same price in the area ...
__label__pos the hotel de lille is the typical place to the few mansions that have made the charm of paris. the rooms are small (not to mention the elevator) but that's what creates its charm. the modesty of the rooms is largely compensated by the reception that the dynamic, young and helpful reception team offers you. (Special mention to Nicolas who always has the word to laugh). See you soon in Lille!
__label__pos in a beautiful district of the 14th, this hotel very well located allows a pleasant stay
__label__pos The hotel is located in the best location in Paris. a few meters from the metro, Notre Dame cathedral and the main streets. next to the courthouse and police (gendarmerie). local very safe, clean and pleasant. the hotel is old and conservative in style. it does not have a lift or 24-hour reception. but the rooms are new (reformed) spacious, airy and clean. big bathroom. breakfast is courtesy of the house. simple, but a lot of taste. nice staff. especially recommend the optimal cost for the location.
__label__pos hotel full of charm and has a very good standard!
__label__pos this is not the ritz, but the price / quality ratio is very good, with a very efficient young team at the reception, a very good location in the center of paris, what more to recommend
__label__pos not tested breakfast. very well located, good value for money
__label__pos super nice welcome, the center of saint germain ... simple decor, quiet atmosphere ... great breakfast for those who love fresh bread. short to recommend for the neighborhood ... I go back for my next training on Paris ...
__label__pos nestled in popular neighborhoods, the kube hotel offers a quirky experience, with a luxurious establishment from the reception in its square courtyard (see cubic), you can admire one or two luxury vehicles that set the scene. the restaurant, known in its beginnings for its ice bar (which in the process is well worth the detour), plays the card of luxury and a polar atmosphere, with its furs. Hotel Kube (little brother of the Murano) offers an all-you-can-eat buffet on Sundays from 11:30 to 17:00. besides hot drinks (tea, coffee illy, hot chocolate), and fresh fruit juices, the menu quot; arty brunch quot; offers sweet side mini pastries (croissants, pain au chocolat, raisin breads, apple baskets), breads, blueberry muffins, mini chocolate muffins, fluted, rum babas, madeleines, apples tatin, waffles, pancakes, rice au vanilla milk with caramel, caramel cream, crème brûlée, mascarpone with strawberries, tart of the day (raspberry, caramelized pears flambé, ganache ...), crumble with three chocolates, fruit salads to compose oneself, cereals, sweets, etc. . the salty buffet is also very rich eggs to order (casserole, boiled, poached, flat, omelette ...) served with bacon and / or poultry sausage, mixed salads, kebabs tomatoes mozzarella, smoked salmon, salmon tartar , royal foie gras, salmon tartare, tuna steak with 3 sesame, scrambled eggs with herring caviar, green fruit gazpacho, 3 sesame prawns on green tomato chutney, assorted cheeses and cold cuts, and dish hot of the day (veal blanquette, chicken curry ...). the menu quot; arty brunch quot; varies according to the seasons, the color of the sky and the desires of the chef but the dishes presented above are great classics. a terrace is installed during the beautiful days. In addition to an exceptional setting and buffet, the kube regularly offers live music and / or art exhibitions. it is advisable to book in advance
__label__pos on the first floor of a modern and trendy bar, there is an all-ice room at -15 degrees. atmosphere guaranteed once down jacket and gloves (lent by the house), the server offers 5 crescendo alcoholic cocktails (attention to the drivers), and you will visit the bedroom ...; ) a place to see. valet service available
__label__pos hotel not at all clean, room too small for 3 people, safe unusable, TV blocked on a single chain, no wardrobe, no heating or hot water on arrival .... unfriendly neighborhood, and welcome to review, the only positive point is the proximity of the subway to travel! the photos on the website do not really correspond to reality, it is not worth a 3 stars!
__label__pos recently renovated, friendly staff, breakfast served at the table, a good cheap address to remember on paris!
__label__pos room not terrible and tiny (street side), better the hotel step next ... it's a chain but the rooms are better
__label__pos I was very disappointed by the quality of this hotel which does not correspond in reality to the images presented on the internet. in a state of disrepair, he would seriously need a refresh. the price does not match the quality of the establishment. when at breakfast, not happy to have to take it to another hotel it is provided by our big dealer quot; liddle quot; , 8 € 50 per person is not acceptable. I also had the unpleasant surprise that the cheapest rooms on the site were among the most expensive in the hotel. in short, I will not go back ... ..
__label__pos the rooms are big and comfortable, the noise of the street does not exist. the breakfast is delicious, varied and plentiful and the conversations very rewarding. the center is not far and Montmartre is a stone's throw away. Finally, if you come to Paris by car, the Abbeville car park is an address where you can leave it for half price thanks to your hosts. the only downside is the inner insulation. the walls are very thin and some indelicate neighbors on the floors seem to love celebrating Saturday night until very late, using the noisy elevator in the middle of the night. that this does not hold you back. take earplugs in case and enjoy all the rest, it would be a shame to miss this ...
__label__pos 25 years stayed at alane hotel, I have never had a problem with the different teams that have followed one another, we are always attentive to the needs and observations of customers, there are many renovations and improvements since last 5 years, the hotel is really very soundproof, you hardly hear the noise when you close the calves. the cleanliness is impeccable, and the breakfast and quite rich. Thanks to the quality of the service, I have already recommended and I continue to invite all those who want to find a clean and convenient hotel to come to Alane Hotel.
__label__pos very good acceuil from the staff (day and night), a little rustic room (but that the people ask quiet hotel, bedding clean, sanitary clean what-what a little rustic too, (television and telephone in good working order ). close to all means of transport in 2 steps. off-center of the sensitive points of the North Station. nice breakfast to take. be careful to get up late! the housewives debouch at 10am. short! I do not say more, otherwise, when I return to Paris, I may not have room.
__label__pos a romantic evening close to the canal saint martin, a stopover in this restaurant with sober and neat decor. we opted for the menu at 25 euros with a good quality foie gras before the dish with a good quality meat and a proper accompaniment, simple but satisfying dessert. good service . I will recommend it to friends
__label__pos excellent ! a very good value for money all in a very nice
__label__pos hi hamid congratulations for the quality of your couscous and the taste of your kitchen in a general way.I hope to see soon some pictures of the restaurant and why not a table well stocked to express the good home that you reserve every day to your customers .bravo again to the whole team and see you soon.
__label__pos I stayed there after a contest won. I will not talk about tariffs. just one thing the hotel has recently been refurbished and tastefully so. but it is absolutely not maintained. our room was very dirty. the slimy floor, all covered with dust, the number of cigarette butts on the balcony, the bathroom door handle left in the hands and the terrible smell of mold all over the room. a very doubtful hygiene.
__label__pos very close to the big rex, the Chamonix is ​​a small hotel set back from boulevard bonne nouvelle. So it's pretty quiet but well located, surrounded by restaurant and cafe. the room is comfortable the air conditioning works, the shower is relatively big and the bed is huge. in addition there is a quilt (and not one of those covers that scratches!) . the only downside is the paid wifi. and the best is the direction of the hotel, I met only lovely people, smiling and helpful!
__label__pos a hotel unworthy of a four-star. No sound insulation between rooms, we hear the neighbors speak normally, not to mention the rest ... at this price is theft. not to mention the internet system at prohibitive price. In the neighborhood there are three star hotels of superior quality, not to mention many 4 stars that respect their customers. a good point of the staff rather nice but can not do anything in this hotel of another age
__label__pos this hotel is perfectly located right in the middle of the republic, on the grand boulevard de magenta. you can go late at night safely ... the staff is great. the reasonable price, wifi is free unlike some 4 stars. I was treated to a large room with balcony and view of the sacred heart!
__label__pos very very good traditional Algerian cuisine couscous, grilled over a wood fire ... a succulent return to its origins. It's a delight . the price is really reasonable for the quality and the freshness of the products. Do not miss ! !
__label__pos attention to the hygiene of the restaurant (meat exposed in full heat). to avoid
__label__pos cocktails at Parisian prices, which can shock sensitive souls. but what cocktails! original mixes, balanced, very pleasant. and naturally, the frame is calm, skillfully decorated so that the conversation will have little trouble taking off (beautiful phallic sculpture at my last visit).
__label__pos Booked at the Hotel de Nemours by ebookers, we had an unpleasant surprise! ... arrived at the hotel, the receptionist told us that they can not receive us and they have redirected us to another hotel located near the station of the east. however we had prepaid 2 nights. super convenient with our luggage ...! they could have prevented before. the room of the other hotel quot; north and champagne quot; was tiny, to reach the shower you had to steer the toilet ... not serious!
__label__pos hotel very friendly, warm welcome, personal care ... very clean room, optimal comfort, beautiful decor and steam room nice after a day of visit! the street of the hotel is quite quiet and the hotel is located one minute from a metro station (4 stops from the island of the city)! a flat lack of coats doors in the room ... in short, I fully recommend!

__label__pos dismal, in the room 216, stained sheets, dirty room, a thick layer of dust on the complaints, the television 36 cm to 2m of the floor diffuses only one chain not to speak of the room of water, the cabin of shower as well as the joints were full of mold and mushrooms. lamentable given the price, I saw cleaner in formula 1! !
__label__pos the flora inn is available according to several concepts. either you opt for tapas to share, or for one (or more dishes) to test. for my part, I opted for a selection of tapas. very good Spanish cold cuts, some delicious croquettas. a boiled egg with morels very interesting. I have less hook on samosas or vegetable salad a little oily. price side, it remains a little the top of the range. the tapas oscillate between 7 and 18 euros (count 3 to 4 per person). menus are also provided.
__label__pos arrived a little by chance in this restaurant, the reception is excellent. the boss is really at the service of his customers responding to our specific requests. the couscous is very good, seed and vegetables at will. the meat is in the same picture good and generous. all for a very reasonable price. to recommend .

Address to avoid absolutely, we were too disappointed! the cashier cashed 10 € more by mistake and dared to call us at the exit saying that he did not count the milk shake, and asking him to redo the calculation he started to yell and he does not even know not excuse.

__label__strneg I know it's not the worst hotel in Paris, but this one I do not recommend ... the home cold, no wifi from 2nd floor, no hot water from 17h, no toilet in my room (and it's not the only one who does not have it!) No take elec other than that of the TV and the bedside lamp, bazaar in the hallway, unfit, ugly decor ... and all that for 74 € / night ... it's expensive!
__label__strneg an unexpected place in Montmartre. outside beaten path, we discover with surprise this place. unimaginable ... we feel elsewhere and privileged to be present in this place as it is sublime! Cock follower, go for it! !

__label__strneg very nice terrace
__label__strneg very nice hotel, nice, quiet and quiet. very well located to visit paris.
__label__strneg we changed very quickly. disappointed that we were
__label__strneg a hotel in a quiet street close to my business and many good restaurants (marcel). the comfort is beyond reproach and all the staff come and go to ask you if you are well. you will feel at home with the whole family and you in bed in convalescence. but, I enjoyed it a lot and since then, I only go home. more bedding, important and top thing.
__label__strneg the reception of some person left to desire, the hotel as a whole is old, it misses a good blow of freshness so that it is pleasant, the carpet of the room is dirty, the bathroom is poorly ventilated of Or odors quite deceptive, the furniture of the room is viellot ... .and I stayed only 3 days it was enough for me! !
__label__strneg corresponds to the advertised range. no more no less . but the welcome is really worth it, just like the Japanese who faces him
__label__strneg average bathroom and really very small. the equipment in the room is poor and do not be foolish about cleanliness. ideal for a stay of one to two nights only ...
__label__strneg small rooms, noisy street, old hotel
__label__strneg to flee absolutely! very noisy as well because of the street (windows that do not close!) only bad sound insulation of the rooms. the employees constantly ask to pay for breakfast and night in advance without giving an invoice while my resa was guaranteed by cb. the cleanliness is approximate.
__label__strneg very friendly staff and listening to the customer. I highly recommend this hotel.
__label__strneg clean, quiet, renovated hotel. smiling and friendly staff.
__label__strneg apart from the fact that this hotel is well located (5-10 min. walk to Montmartre, 15 min. walk to the galleries lafayettes and 3 min. to reach the white square where there is a metro stop), this hotel is miserable! the welcome was most unpleasant. (No one was at the reception when we arrived, the owners were in a small room eating and watching TV ... moreover, when one of the two people decided to come and welcome us, it stank sweat! we are in arizona or the room was small with basic and damaged furniture. the carpet was breaking from every corner. the bathroom was disgusting. the walls were dirty, there were brown rust flows everywhere and hair in the tub, ants in the sink! To believe that the room service was only busy changing the sheets ... at most! there was also a phone available in the room. I do not let you imagine the state of the electric wires ... not really then! report do not ga tif! all for just under 70 euros a night! do not go in any case!
__label__strneg very good location to cituer on the boulevard, very pretty.
__label__strneg Hello everyone, the reception unpleasant, very dusty, I think as long as the hotel is not totally renovated the hotel management should not accept guests because walking in the dust and breathing dust is not good and especially harmful for health! . ! the sheets are hid on the sides, and that does not cover the bed, the bed covers are holes! the most important point in my opinion; the hotel is not in the norm for this essential point, the corridors are very narrow, the big suitcases will not pass, if unfortunately there would be a fire, which I would not like to imagine, people will to be crushed one on the other without even reaching the level of the staircase. ! Personally I do not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.
__label__strneg we stayed one night in this hotel and we were not disappointed the bed was firm, the room very well soundproofed on the street. breakfast was served on time. In short, good advice!
__label__strneg a noise of ventilation motor in the courtyard of the hotel prevents to sleep night and day. shame because the hotel was well located for public transport to Paris.
__label__strneg establishment in good condition. the legendary slowness of the elevators will make you prefer the stairs. do not miss the breakfast in the vaulted cellar. My room 513 was small with a creaky floor and I hope I did not bother the neighbors! the air conditioning is noisy, better to stop to sleep. only one room (to be avoided) is available on the ground floor but it overlooks the street with a very busy sidewalk ...
__label__strneg but what a nice hotel! that everything is fantastico and that I slept as baby oune! that the small breakfast is very very good! and the boss very very pretty!
__label__strneg good location
__label__strneg Do not always dirty. moreover, something is always missing, inadmissible. check well before leaving.
__label__strneg the bamboo at the entrance reflects the atmosphere of the place. conducive to interviews, in front of the house of the radio, the bar-restaurant moves in a hype atmosphere like never, parisiano-cosie. animated with a relaxed atmosphere, just like les mustard, all the comfort is there for a good meal; because it is indeed the card that must hold the attention! !
__label__strneg I dined on June 17, 09 at Zebra Square. setting very well, terrace very noisy but still nice. but then the rest ... the service first very slow (45 minutes between the end of the dish and taking order of the dessert then 20 minutes before the dessert arrives ...), unfriendly and bad advice . to the question quot; ah you have bluefin tuna à la carte, but normally you do not sell it in france quot; , answer quot; oh yes, but we manage each other . the menu mix of classics and world food. very daring and very expensive! Thai beef with coriander comes down to 3 small scoops of beef tartar, coriander sauce and another sauce (worcester type). no research in the proposed fish preparations. and desserts ... in line with what a brewery offers ordinary crème brulee, sorbets, fruits ... to know the dessert quot; strawberries and raspberries quot; 5 strawberries and 4 raspberries (very good indeed) 13 euros all the same! short 300 euros to 4. and a mediocre memory.
__label__strneg server not very friendly. not even speculos or almonds with coffee at 2.30.
__label__strneg a historic hotel, an English bar that has so many stories to tell, a gourmet cuisine and a great location. In short, an address to remember! !
__label__strneg luxury and class; there are often famous people who are at this luxury place; most are all 5 stars but can drop in level if the staff is not up to par, but most remain in 5 stars; there are in all countries
__label__strneg very good dishes, very light.
__label__strneg you have to go because the decor is fabulous. attentive service.
__label__strneg a must-see place
__label__strneg the hotel le claridge des champs elysées is a good hotel very well located, the service is good but remains to be improved, the breakfast is diversify this is a pity. I recommend it even if there is still evolution to be done.
__label__strneg hosts very average high price hotel still works
__label__strneg a little back to avoid noise while staying in the field lights
__label__strneg very good hotel
__label__strneg I advise against ! I stayed there alone for professional reasons on July 1, 2013. the only advantage is that this hotel is close to my place of late appointment, and it is located 2 steps from the Champs Elysées and the Arc de Triomphe. Booked through booking comments and ratings sound fake that does not reflect the reality in any way, I suspect the hotel has charged with positive comments .... Icy and impersonal welcome. rococo loaded kitsch decor, you feel very uncomfortable. the door of my room gives directly into the lobby of the hotel! I have never seen such a thing, it reinforces my pain. the room itself is not bad, but the decor is too kitsch, poorly maintained bathroom, it's not worth a 4 * I must iron my shirt, it happens to me often, and in a 4 * I think it should go ! still uncomfortable, the receptionist told me kind we will have trouble finding an iron, and offers me no other solution (bravo!) finally the receptionist calls me and asks me to pick him up (we could have brought it to me as much as I am 2 meters from the reception!) . I am given an iron that they have to find in a quot; pif gadget quot; and who is running away like a basket, with a barbie ironing board that has his feet completely exploded! (what a shame for a so called 4 *) short, the breakfast at 08:45 not a cat in the breakfast room is pretty, I wait 15minutes person! in addition to the buffet there are 2 croissants that duel, and I always wait for hot drinks! (19 € the breakfast is more of the flight, it is of the foutage of gole!) . exédé, I ask the addition to the receptionist to whom I point out that there is no one at breakfast, it prepares my note without a word without an excuse and especially without proposing to wait and call someone ! Who gives the ratings to the hotels in Paris 4 * is outrageous! this hotel is just a 3 *
__label__strneg not too fan, but good coffee
__label__strneg the hotel is worth zero! it's very bad! I paid (in advance thank you ebookers) 285 euros per night for a dirty room while we believe that the hotel has been completely redone! a very small room! the doors of the rooms slam! the staff visit the rooms whistling, no sign quot; busy quot; . it's very noisy. horrible . a woman's panties was drying in the bathtub .... the bearings are not finished, it's an incredible scam! rooms are dirty , the doors are so noisy . the landing of room are not finished . it is not even one two stars . rooms so small . i have paid 285 euro instead of 570 ( with 50 of discount ) but it is still not ok even at 100 euro . the bread and croissants for breakfast are deep-frozen , the canteens of schools are better provided . this hotel is just a swindle . it is pitiful . still many things to say but i am fed up .
__label__strneg very good and typical, family atmosphere, varied menu with wide choice of dishes of the day. the slate ceremony is nice.
__label__strneg the ideal hotel for a stay in paris; the suite at the top has the most beautiful view of Paris in its entirety; we love the restaurant and always the staff to meet the wishes of customers
__label__strneg it is very beautiful and there is a large selection of shops. it is near the center of paris so you can easily go after a nice sightseeing. maintanant there are a lot of tourists and so the shopkeepers are not super nice. it's still a place to go if you want to go shopping
__label__strneg it looks good or my paoa works)
__label__strneg good reception, the correct room, but I was a little mecantant of the other services
__label__strneg hotel bar. in the lounge bar on the 34th floor of this skyscraper hotel, there is a "coppole" reminiscence of lost in translation. a bar 15 meters long, a luminescent and changing ceiling, the glittering Eiffel tower ... it can be paris or any metropolis with, side cocktails, forgotten recipes and great twisted classics.
__label__strneg Hotel very outdated, which does not deserve its 4 stars. moreover the establishment should lose them with the new hotel classification. the reception staff is not very welcoming and seems pretty poorly trained, there is always a lot of paperwork on the desk that we fear that some confidential data (credit card numbers customers etc.) will get lost ... breakfast side, it is very expensive for the service offered. moreover during our last visit, we had the unpleasant surprise of finding a mouse in the breakfast buffet .... we do not recommend this hotel for private or business purposes. to avoid urgently.
__label__strneg nice little hotel. welcome but efforts to be made on cleanliness
__label__strneg very good acveuil. they are real professionals and that's good.
__label__strneg finally a family hotel and very quiet. I recommand it .
__label__strneg Located close to the madeleine metro station, the hotel is part of the three-star hotel that does not invest continuously to maintain a decent level of hospitality. then of course we are very far from the hotels of pass, intrinsically the reception is good .. but to have in room a smell of very busy tobacco coming from the corridor or other rooms is unbearable. difficult choice open the window and have the continuous noise of the boulevard or sleep with a skull ache. question finishing, decorating date and many details mark the weight of years especially in the bathroom. for one night, without staying in the room all day, no problem. the reception is good and free wifi a good level of coverage. just a pleasant detail, the soap and the shower liquid
__label__strneg reception at the bar mediocre, ambient music lounge failed, snacks (sandwich club 18 euros) cold and foul ... pity for such a beautiful place
__label__strneg you know thierry marx (top chef), you have heard of justin bieber and although in eastern madarin you could meet one or the other but the first one more often as are restaurant is domiciled there. From the budget point of view, it is necessary to plan wide but it remains an unforgettable experience for a passage in Paris.
__label__strneg bad surprise for a hotel that boasts 4 stars tiny rooms, peeling paint, bad general maintenance, dust ...
__label__strneg the restaurant that has just reopened is particularly good.
__label__strneg terrible internet connection
__label__strneg frankly nil. the small room, with a bed in 90, dirty walls, dirty carpet, old tv 36cm al put on a piece of furniture in wood, the windows in wood letting the air and cold, the non soundproofed walls, I spent A sleepless night because of the bars down the street while I was on the 3rd floor! the welcome more than disappointing with the request for a blue card number by phone, the arrival of the hotel and leaving, I've never seen that! and all that for more than 100 euros the room without breakfast! !
__label__strneg I put a small 4 stars to relativize the comments. I have just stayed 2 days room 19 and 125 at this hotel. I almost changed when I saw the comments and in the end, more fear than harm! the reception is ok, clean rooms, bathroom ok too. the hotel is well placed. the least Wi-Fi is not available in the rooms but in a small lounge on the ground floor (we meet the world and it's warm on the other hand). the breakfast is ... not very good (croissant, coffee, chocolate, bread, butter and orange juice). advice ask room 19 or 20 (no noises).
__label__strneg hotel very noisy because my room overlooked the inner street and or unfortunately for me a lot of people gathered to talk high lane even late at night, the walls inside his sheet of paper, I thought for a moment that my neighbor was showering in my room. we do not talk about the cleanliness of the stairwell that had to be sucked long ago, the room that stinks the cigarette, for a non-smoker hello joy and finally the staff who welcome you without really care about you, as if you break their feet. I stop here for the critics, the only advantage is its pity that it is in such bad shape.
__label__strneg very very noisy hotel not calm as advertised on the quote home no one and manager unfriendly lack of freshness, breakfast pat at the top interviews of the establishment to review again although it was only to sleep and if you really want to sleep take with you earplugs and a blindfold
__label__strneg this hotel is a disaster and a model for dirt. believing finding a mean standard related to membership in the group choice, what a disappointment to find a ridiculously small room (No. 62), horribly dirty (with still hair on the TV remote control 36 cm of quot; x quot; years of age ...) and as a bonus smelly odors coming from the shower. to complete the description, bedding dating from another age and drip leak of the flush very friendly all night. in summary, a hateful hotel to avoid absolutely for who wants a minimum of comfort and cleanliness.
__label__strneg to recommend even for young families.
__label__strneg the reception presents well, the reception is very correct. but the problem is at the level of the small room, but it is usual in Parisian hotels. very low ceiling, it's pretty smothering a smell of quot; old quot; and stale, even after airing. cracked deco wall catastrophic. I think we had an emergency room at the hotel, though we had booked in advance.
__label__strneg a 3-star hotel visibly lacking in the dead main electric bulb, toilet bowl unsealed, faucet sink rattling, missing a lampshade on 2 bedside lamps, TV disconnected electricity and antenna (you have to search to find. hotel at a pinch 1 star ...
__label__strneg Uncomfortable room, breakfast without a real choice. It is not possible to bring a tea or a coffee in his room because no cups. the staff are welcoming but that does not save the day. to avoid !
__label__strneg nice room but a little noisy at night because close to home. big tv. good bedding. friendly staff. I recommend .
__label__strneg mythical !
__label__strneg I went to the Trocadero Gardens, but did not look forward to seeing them again after seeing them for the first time. my sister did a lot of trocadero skating and did some competitions
__label__strneg very good bar of the chain cost. I really recommend going on a summer evening on the terrace overlooking the military school. the establishment closes at three in the morning which is very convenient when you want to end an evening with friends or with his girlfriend.
__label__strneg it seems that this hotel is associated with fn (racist and xenophobic political party)
__label__strneg great hotel, a lot of trouble to leave ...; )
__label__strneg a welcome for this hotel. the decoration of the common rooms is correct; small flat nevertheless for the conference room, the finishes appeared to me coarse; a little disappointed with the decor of the basic rooms and the tenuous schedules of the spa and bar. I saw 4 stars better.
__label__strneg the atmosphere is stilted and deceptively casual, but the place remains one of the most privileged of paris!
__label__strneg Hello, I am a web consultant for this hotel. in the immediate vicinity of the louvre. I highly recommend it . the team is top and location dream, 2 steps from the royal palace and the louvre museum in paris. david r
__label__strneg the service is a bit slow but the setting is very nice!
__label__strneg good hotel, good location. a young and nice team.
__label__strneg on a mission to paris a few weeks for my work, I wanted to feel quot; at home quot; rather than in the usual hotels, and be able to change my mind at night. the studio found is ultimately cheaper than the hotel, and very well placed. it is small, but as I am not much, it is not very serious (the surfaces in Paris have little to do with the province, anyway). very cozy, there are many books, CDs and DVDs and everything is very functional. the neighborhood is really busy, and I think I'll adopt that formula in the future.
__label__strneg really to avoid, lack of cleanliness, the reception has become very detestable, when something is missing in your room limit quot; that's how it's done with quot; advice wisely wait until the reception finishes talking to a friend, as there is no place or wait go back to your room and go back as soon as the gentleman has finished his very important interview with his friend. if he looks down on you, it's because he has not finished his conversation. Avenue Jaures is very noisy at night, especially from midnight, slightly alcoholic people and drug addicts, fortunately the police watch. the price is far too high compared to the quality home / cleanliness / location. no more than 30 euros. all this to say that I do not recommend this establishment. really to avoid , lack of cleanliness , the reception became very terrible , when something miss in your romm , something like quot ; it is like that made with it quot ; . advice wait wisely that the reception stops discussing with a friend , as there is no place it is better to return in your room and go back as soon as the quot ; sir quot ; will have finished his very important interview with his friend . if he send you a grim look it is because he did not finish his conversation.the avenue jaurès became very noisy in the evening , especially from midnight , sometimes slightly alcoholized persons and drug-addict , fortunately the police watches . for all those things , the price is very too high compared to the quality of the reception/ cleanliness location . i think that no more than 30 euros would be good price . then you will do not feel embarrassed . all it to say that i disadvise this establishment . really very disappointed by the total , miss of professionalisme
__label__strneg Friendly staff, very clean room, perfect for short stay. only the location leaves something to be desired because one moves away from montmartre to arrive in barbes.
__label__strneg I stay in this hotel in 2007. This hotel does not respect the standards of hygiene, there are cockroaches, the furniture is broken, the shower does not work, the toilets are constantly flowing and the bosses are very rude (and racist); ; ; in short to avoid at all costs ... we also try to rip you off financially, this said in passing ... I would suggest to the committee of hygiene and the prefecture of paris to make a turn ... this hotel deserves the closure !
__label__strneg the reception is very friendly, but the services leave something to be desired.
__label__strneg hotel well located near the park of Buttes Chaumont. you have to choose your room on the inner courtyard side because the noise of the street is sometimes embarrassing.
__label__strneg we stayed here for one night, from 31/12 to 01/01/13! what a desappointment ! when we talk about relays, for a night at 93 € we could pretend to better because between the dirty bedspread, the bathroom where we asked if it was cleaned (hair stuck on the door, stained wall, seal the sink that comes off, shower head that does not hold ...), the lack of soundproofing (we hear everything! the cell phone of the people in the next room sounds as if it were in yours! when people come back, it looks like they are talking as if they were in your room, the sound of the footsteps of people passing by in the hallway, the sirens of firefighters ...) ... I let you imagine ... Only nice points hotel 200m from the metro and the helpful staff ... the hotel leaves a bitter taste!
__label__strneg Having known the hotel for twenty-eight years, it has changed. of appearance (as stewardess karina and her husband). to start with both of you and the team.
__label__strneg you can not even stand up in room 64. no
__label__strneg good basic hotel with metro station 10m and parking next 50m for family cheap
__label__strneg good to spend a night, but pay wifi access 5 € the day is to take customers for what they are not!
__label__strneg Hello, we spent a week in this family-type hotel which has more than delighted us with its welcome as well as the rooms and breakfasts. we can only recommend this property. Simone and Gregory.
__label__strneg the welcome and comfort of the rooms
__label__strneg we had a wonderful weekend at 3chambres! everything is there, the decoration, the colors, the equipment in the bed and breakfast without forgetting the welcome, the breakfast and the famous cake of laurent, the host of these places ... we can only advise this bed and breakfast in the heart of Paris.
__label__strneg the idea is sensational i find
__label__strneg what a really unpleasant welcome!
__label__strneg arrived in the evening and after calling in the morning to confirm my arrival after 18h, unpleasant surprise more room available!
__label__strneg the food in the restaurant of this hotel is good but the service is slow and sometimes approximate. we ordered two different dishes and no difference when seeing them arrive. however the dishes were very good.
__label__strneg Very nice home . modest room but fully equipped. the bar / restaurant at the entrance of the hotel makes the place more secure when you come back late at night because there is always someone.
__label__strneg this hotel is abominable. I went there 2 times. the first time, there were rats in the room. the second time, I was given a room that was already occupied. on entering the room we saw that she was busy. this was reported to the receptionist. this guy had the audacity to ask us if we did not have quot; stolen luggage quot; before coming to him in addition, I paid by credit card, a foreign card. he had no other free rooms of the same price. he offered us more expensive rooms, but we declined. then, he could not pay us back, he told us to wait for the boss. we waited an hour. he promised to pay us back in cash. he told us to pay a charge of 4 euros .... we refused to pay 4 euros for their mistake. the boss came and did not want to pay us back in cash. I explained to him that I needed the money because I have limits on my card. I explained to him that the money did not come to my account right away, because there is a delay of 3 days. she did not want to listen to me, and now I'm in trouble because the money is not available ... they even had the audacity to tell me that it was my fault ... and my responsibility . they even asked me to pay them 4 euros..when they do not know how to manage their hotel. and it is they who refused to give me these 4 euros. abominable ... .
__label__strneg home more than average with regard to the 3 *, preparation of the room more than average (it was missing a bed and power outlets did not work waiting time repair 1 / 2h, a bath towel felt full nose fondue bourguignone ! and I'm not even kidding). on the other hand, the staff outside reception is very nice. the hotel is well located, quiet not far from paid parking and a metro stop. great restaurant at 500 m (nicolas flamel hostel for an unforeseen trip). the suites are spacious. last flat, the breakfast. we are used to 3 * and this is the first time we have the choice between at least 3 varieties of jams! revealing. it is therefore a 2 *.
__label__strneg lousy! horrible ! beware ! attention ! Mauvaise is dirty, smells horrible and the service is terribly bad. it 's quite dirty , the smell is awful and do n't get me started on the service ! it's really sal! it smells horribly and the service is really bad! not to approach
__label__strneg this hotel is a rip off! it's a trompe l'oeil! we paid 220 euros saying we were given a deluxe room at 275 euros! the room was shabby, the bed in 160 bathtub version, I think the bed was at least 20 years old, the tele 20 inch 80s! and it says 4 stars! go rather novotel chatelet for 30 euros more is a good standard ...
__label__strneg despite a reservation made 2 weeks before my arrival, with confirmation, more room available on my arrival. I was made to sleep in a studio ... but I was asked to pay in cash, which I refused. 2 nights in a studio without wifi access. attention for companies, the bills are not feasible by the people at the reception, do not know how to calculate the VAT. cheap breakfast ... very light masi.
__label__strneg very small common areas. unspeakable, tiny, poorly ventilated rooms overlooking a tiny courtyard and facing the kitchen of a residential building. (rooms x06) smells, vents and other fireplaces as view. do not expect to see the sky. walls, kind of nest-dust mite tissue, stained with boogers, dubious carpet. the rooms are poorly insulated, we can easily hear the neighbors. the rooms x04 overlook a courtyard a little larger. they are quot; accessible quot; disabled people ... unrealistic. the bathroom, quot; to the Italian quot; or cabins had many molds. opt for rooms facing the street as a last resort. double glazing . (Rooms x01-x02) The air conditioning and heating system is old and out of order. it sits in the middle of tiny rooms. many disparate electric heaters that give a DIY feel. the curtains are dirty, no duvets but old blankets. little more, the volunteer staff, despite the many angry and disrespectful hosts who expected better.
__label__strneg very good restore
__label__strneg good plan in the center of paris
__label__strneg any reception and room supposed soundproof noisy. to avoid
__label__strneg not so catastrophic
__label__strneg very warm welcome, good service and very personal
__label__strneg unhealthy and dangerous infested with bed bugs
__label__strneg I slept there one night in early December 2010, single room seems it (but a double bed). shabby. a blind room on the ground floor, visibly under the stairs. woke up at 4:30 by customers in stiletto heels. saw the other reviews, I imagine other rooms are better but beware! i spent a night there , beginning of december 2010 . i had a single room , on the ground floor , windowless . just shabby . obviously under the stairs . woke up at 4:30 a.m . by young ladies with spike heel . not sexy at all . considering the other message , i think that i had a bad experience but take care !
__label__strneg This hotel is a pure scam. on the site all rooms are equipped with toilets and television. in fact the rooms are filthy dirty without a toilet or television. the reception is miserable and threatening if one makes a point of claiming. to avoid at all costs. it will be as long as the health authorities are interested in this hotel before a problem arrives.
__label__strneg do not give the address to everyone
__label__strneg the very improved area next to Djiboutian
__label__strneg cheap . but should there be hotels with so little comfort!
__label__strneg silent courtyard room, except a regular thump (subway boiler). the vacuum had not been gone for some time, anyway, not the day j. unbeatable price, in connection with the service. very friendly welcome.
__label__strneg the internet does not work at this hotel. which is not a problem in itself except that the receptionist, not only is incompetent in the matter but also tries to take the client for an idiot. finally, when it becomes too obvious, it is always the receptionist who becomes aggressive and vulgar, with the approval of his boss ... a nightmarish stay! the solution to offer him the book quot; emotional intelligence for dummy quot; or change of receptionist. or change hotels.
__label__strneg very good stay!
__label__strneg do not be fooled by the website which shows nice pictures and a pleasant environment. Cautious I went to visit the hotel before making a reservation for a third person. stupor a dark hall and totally faded, no elevator, the double room that was shown sordid! a horror !
__label__strneg I was invited to Villa Bellagio by Zagat for their famous happy hour. Villa Bellagio is not just a bar but also a hotel. New York-style decor with red brick walls, tag writing, subdued lighting and photos that honor Hollywood stars. then we sit quietly on the sofa to order food. the pizzas are good but service a little long. I was told about their famous tacos, to test next time so. in the end, good atmosphere, good music, good cocktails and good food, a place to go between friends without hesitation.
__label__strneg old and sad hotel that needs a serious refresh. certainly the high rooms have a nice view. the very basic breakfast served in the room (no dining room) is certainly not worth the price. the wifi does not work well.
__label__strneg this hotel ... in a quiet area, the rooms clean, the owners very warm
__label__strneg to avoid, simply, we spent a week, the towels are not changed, the various insects invite you to your room, hotel near a bar very nice but very noisy, some rooms have just been renovated, it does not excuse anything, everything else is a throw away, the staff is useless, the beds not done or done in half! if you come for more than one night go your way.
__label__strneg I greatly enjoyed my stay because in addition to the rooms that were beautiful, the hotel has a person friendly, helpful and really very friendly that will delight the whole family and even the grandparents. very good hotel.
__label__strneg We had booked a week before arrival. We were told nothing about the lack of an opportunity for cancellation. the next day we had to change the plans 160 euro penalty money were charged complete demolition caution. we reserved one week in advance but no annulation term was mentioned . we had to cancel the trip the same day . the hotel charged 160 annulation fee . no good service at all . rather crooks . be aware on booked a week in advance without the hotel telling us that there is no possibility of cancellation. we had to change the trip the same day. they charged us 160 euros worth of thieves attention, no customer service.
__label__strneg Nice hotel and very clean. warm welcome ... the rooms are small (especially 25 euros) but quite clean and well kept .. it's worth it to go there.

__label__strpos price / quality ratio quite correct. the room was clean, the bedding in good condition, rather nice, flat screen tv, small desk ... the bathroom was basic (small, 1 soap, 1 sachet of shampoo and 1 towel), but clean and suitable for 1 night. the room was facing street, a bit noisy until late evening but not at all annoying at night (for my part). you can easily hear the noise of other hotel guests circulating in the corridors and nearby doors. the welcome by the staff was friendly. to finish the hotel is very well located, quite lively district, close to the metro and it is 30 minutes walk from the Champs Elysees, room pleyel, passing by batignolles ... to conclude very correct for 1 night (business stay) ), you sleep well, well placed, no bad surprise. lack of charm for a stay quot; romantic quot; .

__label__strpos the restaurant room is very beautiful and quiet. the tables are far away. the waiters are friendly and advise you well.

__label__strpos beautiful 2 star hotel completely redone, spacious rooms with a magnificent view of the sacred heart and the school garden. bar, snack, frankly hats.
__label__strpos great hotel 2 stars, new, very nice home. I recommend ; )
__label__strpos the choppe of the red castle, it is a particular, popular atmosphere, where people of all styles, of all ages and of all social classes mix. one of the few places that can still welcome this! the prices are very low and we are quickly served, provided we make our way to the counter (do not worry, it's not that difficult)! the toilets are not the most fantastic we've seen, but it's a real popular bar!
__label__strpos it is that which is great with the tankard is that in the morning we cross the world, with computers, regular coffee counter, writers etc ... and that we can return at night in a total other atmosphere, where the beer flows! of the world, of the world!
__label__strpos pleasant brasserie
__label__strpos I am French, I rented this apartment well placed in the heart of Paris, I spent in this cozy place extraordinary moments. my wife was delighted. I really recommend this place to everyone.
__label__strpos ok but nothing more. the room I had was big but the bathroom downright tiny for me who am a little tall is not practical. moreover I was a little embarrassed by the sound of a ventilation or something that crossed the wall of my room. for the price it's a bit pricey!
__label__strpos useful but expensive
__label__strpos good but still expensive
__label__strpos a quiet and pleasant hotel with very friendly people. a few meters from the Gare du Nord and the Gare de l'Est. some difficulties of internet connection from the room on the 1st floor.
__label__strpos saved by its location and staff. is not worth the price paid.
__label__strpos no air conditioning and extremely small rooms. not clearly worth the price.
__label__strpos does not deserve the 3 stars the soundproofing is very bad despite what is stated no heating in the room on arrival bathroom outdated without comfort
__label__strpos Much too expensive for this hotel. hotel sale
__label__strpos to avoid ! much too expensive for value for money room with tapestry ripped, no air conditioning (a fan is placed on a table), no double glazing, televisions do not work (2 channels only work), breakfast included but rudimentary .. Poster 3 stars while it deserves only 2 (can be and still).
__label__strpos for staying there every week (1 night to 2 night per week) for 1 year ... i tested almost every room! rooms completely redone in 2011/2012 beautiful bathroom even if the small home is perfect and at any time. and the price finally correct for paris! to finish super easy access stations north or east (10min walk).
__label__strpos not bad is not expensive
__label__strpos three good
__label__strpos great restaurant, very nice home, excellent value for money and one of the best entrecôtes of the city!
__label__strpos I only know the restoration part that is very nice decor to the service and all for very reasonable prices. a place to go!
__label__strpos We spent a very good week at 4. quiet street.
__label__strpos After spending one night in this hotel I was very surprised and amazed at the calm that reigns in the hotel. indeed we do not believe in Paris while we are right on the street Faubourg fishmonger. a real happiness for a sleeper.
__label__strpos very well
__label__strpos welcome, location and value for money excellent! !
__label__strpos the staff are really friendly, just sometimes the water is not hot enough (especially in the floors). otherwise, convenient access via the metro and the reception is provided 24/24!
__label__strpos excellent reception, clean and pleasant room. hotel well located, easy access. Very good value for money .
__label__strpos does not deserve the 2 *
__label__strpos first of all a very well placed hotel. train station, metros, theaters, entertainment, everything is accessible on foot ... after, the staff is very welcoming, and very nice. Finally, the room is clean, quiet, tastefully appointed, and has a super comfortable bedding. we loved it ! !
