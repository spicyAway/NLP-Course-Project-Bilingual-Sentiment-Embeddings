__label__neg Well placed, some personal hospitality is particularly welcoming and accommodating. the studios are small but practical, functional and very clean. wifi connection rj45. free internet downstairs at the reception. car wash matic level -1. waste separation . small bag available if you want to do your shopping next to the simply market. in short, very good, even if the prices are very high, like everywhere in the neighborhood.
__label__neg we took a room at this hotel on December 31, 2009; and, although the time spent in this one was very short, we would have had to abstain from sleeping, and make a sleepless night ... that would have cost us less, and at least we would not have suffered all the night , odors, mites, cold, bad general condition of the room. in short, I do not recommend this establishment, and you should also be wary of presentations made on the net.
__label__neg friendly hotel. good value for money, especially since it is very well located. the reception is pleasant and the breakfast room looks like a German-pratin vault!
__label__neg sad experience for me. radiator down in the middle of January dubious cleanliness. To this is added the very petty way that the front desk did not tell you on arrival that your breakfast will be charged. you will find yourself at the handing over of the keys to have to pay a huge sum. I avoid this hotel and advise against my loved ones
__label__neg I have been wondering for more than 1 hour why the employees of the post office do they phone them it is impossible to reach them especially in the 92 I tried all the phone numbers that I found the post platform parcel in any j have tried 6 different number tjr put on hold and never anyone at the end of the wire it is 10:35 and I began looking for my package around 9:15. it's just a shame what horror the world will not change is there are still gents like the postal workers ... do you really want my opinion of course that no
__label__neg Negative room very outdated, no free wifi as displayed, noisy, minimal comfort, cleanliness doubtful. does not match the description on the site! High rate for this type of hotel 77 euros single room.
__label__neg in a dead end, hotel very clean, very quiet. courteous welcome by a friendly and considerate receptionist. room in very good condition. only reserve not found the electric plug for the razor in the bathroom!
__label__neg shabby hotel. old, dirty and poorly equipped. very noisy single glazing next to Boulevard de la Gare de Lyon. to avoid at all costs.
__label__neg hotel arenes has too many stars small rooms not very clean bathroom unhygienic staff not gracious for a double room booked we are given a triple room with 3 small beds! very poor value for money we will not go back
__label__neg free wifi public transport the staff is very nice i really love this hotel all the chain novotel is not bad I do not want to go anywhere else that down I love the pool is very heated and it is not regrettable in short is at the top! !
__label__neg never come to this hotel. the staff is not understanding. be careful because the cancellation policy is very poorly written and therefore difficult to understand. Do not stay at this hotel.
__label__neg an average hotel, but the proximity to the train station is convenient. I enjoyed the bath. on the other hand it is sorely lacking a minibar and air conditioning in the rooms in summer, the heat is difficult to bear ...
__label__neg I enjoyed this small hotel simple and welcoming. a smiling staff and really nice (it's not so common in our dear capital). a single room without more or less, perfect bedding, the street is quiet (well I went on a Monday night). the breakfast is already prepared when you arrive, you do not have to go to help yourself and the coffee arrives quickly. In short, nothing to say!
__label__neg rotten! this hotel is in line with most 2 * amp hotels; 3 * from Paris to know very old local tourist catchers, tiny rooms / bathrooms and unhealthy limit with prices up to our disappointment! therefore to avoid absolutely.
__label__neg an adorable service for a small cafe on zinc before work by chatting or reading the news of the day available ... momo always has a smile!
__label__neg if there is noise, it is because we are in Paris we have answered you! for the proposed rates (even if we are in Paris) we could wait better; walls sheets cigarettes, no one that morning in breakfast room, impressment em em ... ..er this morning or we simply asked for a new room. wrong address !
__label__neg my parents, aged, spent 2 nights for the end of year holidays 2012. they did not have heating and a water damage took place in the room. they had to change it. not to mention the greeting, we managed to see a manager only when paying. this one was bad faith and very aggressive. the breakfast was not served on the 2 days, by lack conclusion hotel definitively to be avoided, in full decadence.
__label__neg a good hotel, not luxurious but clean and with a good welcome.
__label__neg I spent 3 nights here with a friend. I asked for a double room, we had to settle for a large bed ... the bedding is in very bad condition, I woke up with body aches, the lighting of the bathroom (above the mirror did not work ! ) , the cleanliness leaves something to be desired. the bed was not made on the 2nd day, the bedspread was just pulled on the sheet .. the breakfast is average, the coffee undrinkable! the staff does not speak French, and is obviously not professional. the positive sides quiet room, near the goblins (5 minutes walk), well located in Paris.
__label__neg we stayed 10 days in the city. we have only good to say about this place. As soon as we arrived very early in the morning, our room was ready. we felt at home as soon as we entered the apartment. it's very big, surprising even. full kitchen, dishwasher, microwave, wireless internet, everything is there. the staff is very kind, attentive and knowledgeable. a shopping center is in the same building. therefore, all the businesses we need are below us. Our trip consisted of visiting Paris. we only had to cross the street to get to the metro and so did not waste time. I recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to go with family or friends and live in the same apartment. it's the ideal, believe me! thank you to the city. we had a wonderful trip and it's a lot thanks to you. thank you !
__label__neg bad experience of burglary (several hundred euros) in the room while it was closed and the key was at the reception. the staff is unfriendly, unhelpful, irresponsible and disrespectful. the management is absent and obviously hated by the staff. searching on the internet other customers have already reported flight problems. it is a shame for the chain ibis and accor. it is obvious that I recommend to everyone to avoid this hotel more than doubtful and to go elsewhere to have a pleasant stay!
__label__neg Subway vibrations felt slightly until 1am (it's not their fault) scandal no rate posted! no real dining room for breakfast and do not expect to choose your jam ... the bed is good channel yes but do not dream of the satellite ... and the TV is very bad! no room for the legs in the toilet (room 16) short we are far from a hotel at 80 €! 50 € would be a correct price!
__label__neg deplorable home behavior on the verge of aggression on arrival and departure not the room on the third is not soundproofed for indoor noise. the tapestry and carpet very damaged, chromo on the wall to hide one of the many holes is unbearable to look at. obviously the remote works halfway. the hotel obviously receives a lot of tourists, it is a shame for the Parisian hotel industry. in positive, apart from the location, I do not see. there are dozens of hotels at this price in Paris where, at least, the reception is correct.
__label__neg very good reception, attractive prices. the rooms are correct, have tv, shower and wc. in the morning, breakfast is enough. only small negative bridge, the size of the bathroom. I recommand it .
__label__neg very pleasantly surprised because I was expecting a cold and austere stay in the image of the architecture of the office building 80 's! it's a very good idea to have played the contrasts by a hobby in color, a little club med, i-tech with electrical outlets everywhere, including the small room dej, multimedia airlock in the lobby with pc, printers and lan plug, video entrances near the bed to connect his pc to the tv and a large and attentive staff. great idea to have the door of the corridor (in the rooms) to isolate noise! it's rare . +1 for the breakfast buffet which is not quot; continental quot; but very varied and with a real orange juice in a hurry! +1 also for the space quot; child quot; , the small multilingual library, the press available and the cleanliness of the place. Only weak point, the rooms are not glamorous and we will avoid coming for a honeymoon. Other than that, it's a good address.
__label__neg comfortable hotel 3 nights out of 4 Thursday night was quot; stirring quot; from 4 am if you need to travel with medications that require refrigeration you are told that there are no problems when booking. then on arrival, you are told that it is exceptional and that the package must be small.
__label__pos the ghd is really great beien it sell straighteners breathtaking but the price is also a cut off the sulfur lol 200euro yes it is a bit expensive for a straightener but it is really worth buying it is really a very good deal for The person who has curly hair stiffens them by passing once he does not damage the hair and in addition they give them shine.
__label__pos with my wife, we rented a room in this hotel, the first hotel, and what a welcome we got on arrival! they said that they had some problems with some of their clients who had taken pictures in their hotel without their permission. when we arrived, they forced us to open our suitcases and search them to see if we did not have a camera. we did not accept, by principle, and they would not let us go! so we had to find another hotel at the last minute! I do not recommend this hotel at all, the welcome is worthy of a hotel pass ...
__label__pos Craftsman serious plumber on Paris 11th rates are clear and reasonable a good plumbing address in Paris
__label__pos a stone's throw from luxembourg, senate and sciences-po, this magnificent church is an interesting monument to visit. it is from the outside that he is the most impressive. its size, its architecture can only make us feel very small next door. a beautiful fountain on the forecourt makes the place rather pleasant to land.
__label__pos Friendly hotel, but we prefer the small mansions full of charm which is filled the neighborhood.
__label__pos hotel of very good quality or the rooms are clean, the home is impeccable. Newspaper service is offered as well as hot drinks in the rooms. nothing to say about the cleanliness of the rooms. I recommend it.
__label__pos hotel very well located in the montparnasse district, close to the garden of luxembourg and close to restaurants. Friendly and very helpful host. the breakfasts are great. the room is small but functional and the air conditioning was very much appreciated.
__label__pos an acceptable room considering the prices and the neighborhood, but a bed for 2 people catastrophic. how can we dare to offer 86 euros per night (anyway) a bed smashed with a central bowl as we wake up every hour because we slip
__label__pos I am delighted to have had such a pleasant time with my companion in your hotel! ideal for a romantic weekend to stroll in the Latin Quarter! thank you to all the team of your home, your hotel is a gem!
__label__pos The hotel was recommended by friends, it was my surprise a few days to spend at the hotel, at first I took a night to see, but later, I lengthened my stay and I regret not to the warm welcome, even their microwave and personal fridge is available to guests by simple request, even the breakfast is affordable 3 €, in addition to the room that is not expensive with a free shower on the landing , and channel + channels and wifi which was my surprise compared to the price, the only inconvenient not CB, but generally acceptable for a room with shower and toilet between 51 61 €
__label__pos we chose this hotel to participate in the lounge batimat following the description of the site. we were very disappointed as the hotel is a bit old and the amenities are poor. moreover, if you stay on the upper floors, you have no water. and the staff does not care. we were not able to benefit from a discount due to inconvenience. we strongly discourage this hotel! !
__label__pos there are renovated rooms and other no, which changes the value for money ... very much that everything is renovated ... it will be perfect ... I once had a room that left something to be desired especially the bathroom (faucet leaking, impossible to empty the sink, window that closed badly ...). more or less noisy depending on the room. Regular customer of the hotel, I must still recognize that in the majority of cases there is not much to say about the service. friendly staff and breakfast ok
__label__pos problem poorly insulated rooms you can hear everything going on in the next room! breakfast limit; a mini buffet would be better. Other than that, price / quality ratio very correct.
__label__pos horrible hotel, shabby, dirty, made of odds and ends, breathing insecurity in the nose (especially when a prostitute makes the tap in front of the entrance and takes her customers back to this pigsty) ... do not believe srtt the few quot; testimonials quot; positive about it, which are without any doubts deposited by employees of this hotel to raise its rating and deceive people by touting non-existent qualities! run away ! !
__label__pos Perfect ... only downside ... a bit expensive.
__label__pos Unworthy pizzeria, the pizzas are served in dessert plates. on the card the price is ok but when you see the pizza arrive; sodebo quot; the scam is here. as usual the restaurants near the train stations are to be avoided. I do not even mention tiramisu quot; home quot; from metro to 8euros ....
__label__pos at younice is a great Moroccan restaurant! served by younice itself, you will not be disappointed by the warm welcome and delicious typical dishes that take you directly to Morocco thanks to the flavors and warm atmosphere of the restaurant! really cheap for quality and quantity (no more than 11 € for tagines and 9 € for kebabs). to recommend in fact the very good value for money and above all an owner who deserves to be known! to make known to all your entourage! takeaway also. (you can if you wish to bring back to the restaurant with you your bottle of wine).
__label__pos hello we just spent the weekend, and I want to thank you for the welcome, the kindness of the staff. we will be back for sure. see you soon
__label__pos Hello, a very good price / quality ratio. Very nice home .
__label__pos my experience at the Hotel Maxim was most unpleasant and I do not think I can attribute this to bad luck. from the management to the morphology of the rooms, all bell. the overall quality is below the standard two stars and certainly does not deserve 125 euros. firstly, the cleanliness is downright deficient. stained sheets (which stayed there all week), sticky shower curtain, dusty surfaces. the deco, who has seen branche et moderne, is it well if I went that I'm in disrespectful défraîchi and you overwhelm. the mattress is antediluvian, the shower is Lilliputian (even according to Paris standards) and the water jet without pressure. in wishing to shorten my stay, I hit an arrogant staff and very little accommodating. One night, I even had to spend 15 minutes in front of the front door of the hotel, ringing constantly, without anyone coming to open me. only advantages the location, the quiet street ... but they can not compensate for the lack of professionalism of this establishment.
__label__pos Great location in the Latin Quarter, a chic and design hotel completely redone. the staff is very hospitable and attentive, the services are upscale, bedding top, parquet floor, decor. very nice. , eco label home products. in addition to two steps from the metro goblins and surrounded by bus lines to access all the monuments to visit. to try absolutely; d
__label__pos an open and available staff, a newly renovated room, quiet, close to several metro, good value for money to know.
__label__pos friendly welcome. hearty breakfast. restaurant good value for money. quiet but room and bathroom small and old.
__label__pos Average hotel, noisy (device) although I asked for a quiet room, room seen on the ring road. on arrival room wide open to everyone. no wifi on the 4th floor because too far from the source.bien expensive for the benefit.
__label__pos good then, what shocked me is dirt. the lack of hygiene, I was disgusted, but ... the reception is very good, breakfast too, although quite stressful (indeed the room is too small compared to the number of customers) for one or two nights it goes! and I forgot the rooms are overheated (I did not find a way to lower the radiator thermostat!)
__label__pos Charming hotel, there is a very nice stairs-library. the rooms are spacious, the shower rooms are well optimized but narrow. the reception is pleasant.
__label__pos very friendly and very professional welcome, massage of the same ilk, a real moment of relaxation and an oriental getaway at the gates of Paris; remains a little expensive for my taste, but they are tariffs that must avoid a certain population and allow them this status!
__label__pos 3 day stay we wanted cheaper, but served! washbasin, shower, toilet, in a tiny hallway, en enfilade, you shower, to go to the toilet you soak your feet since you have to walk in the shower! , 2 small towels to wipe (couple), creaky doors (entry and bathroom) inexpensive 7.5 euros for coffee with rest of washing up liquid! (that bubble and gout infect) the 2nd day, more coffee on the 3rd day, (8h15!) a piece of white bread (at will) and a short croissant, very disappointed, we will go elsewhere ... in autumn
__label__pos very good address in Paris, a b amp; b as we like a home top, small dej very well and neat, the room is not very large, but the bed and bedding are at the top. Yes, the villa is out of the way and not close to metro stations, but this is compensated by the calm of the quariter, the Velib stop just below (as well as a bus stop). sound insulation between rooms is not terrible; but that did not prevent us from sleeping very well. globally to advise.
__label__strneg I stayed at the hotel on the 4th of September in September 2013 with my husband, we were in a deluxe room which was very bright. the staff was very smiling and listened to what I appreciated. moreover the hotel is very well located close to metro stations vavin, montparnasse and notre dame des champs. we keep very good memories hoping to stay there during our next trip to paris.
__label__strneg no, no, and no! after a deplorable welcome, surprised to find a very small room (less than 5 cm between the door of the room and the bed!) , with a superb door quot; it can not be more ordinary quot; (ie non-acoustic hollow cell type!) overlooking the next room, which allows us to follow everything that happens in the next room! (and conversely ...) then find that the sheets are stained, that the mold remains in the shower, accumulation (and the word is weak!) dust to the exhaust mouth of the vmc, forgetting a sponge (dirty recess) on the windowsill ... not to mention that the front door that gives directly to the outside is quot; veiled quot; , so let the air pass considerably, as well as the rubber seals of the window that quot; dangle quot; outside ... no one, no and no! !
__label__strneg .. can be much better by putting tomato ... however the concept is good and attractive price especially if you are hungry before going to the movies. once again you have to put less fat and more tomato, because otherwise it is really indigestible which is shameful when you take a pizza with vegetables on it ...
__label__strneg very welcome, very nice furniture, but particularly dirty! 1st chb sink clogged; 2nd chb proposed coffee drips on the radiators, rust, black joints in the shower, thick carpet unhygienic bed cover very very doubtful, we did not change the sheets of the week when it should have been done, not Alaises on the mattresses and we followed the green advice to keep the towels (paper displayed on the doors) and there we were changed (when it should not ..). big problem of interest of the managers to the finishes, dirty ceilings, paving put by a pig, basic cleaning baclé. does not deserve its 3 stars.
__label__strneg Disappointment ... the room allocated had not been cleaned, which did not worry the staff, despite the high price of the room for only 10sqm bathroom included. heating to a maximum also allowed to exceed 30 ° C, a record for one month in April. the breakfast consisted mainly of bread and dry pastries, already visible at the arrival of the day before.
__label__strneg expensive for a room with a non-functional heating, not clean and a small dej without bread and too many industrial products
__label__strneg good hotel and very good for the cartier! !
__label__strneg good reception, nice performance I would return with pleasure
__label__strneg very friendly staff but we enter the room in the middle of the day carpet does not burn water in the toilet for example room 24 can not call the hotel a trickle of water in room 14 to flee 1/20 for the reception very nice
__label__strneg attracted by the location we had the misfortune to sleep in this hotel. our rooms were dirty, stinking and outdated and for coronne all the people from the charming reception to the reservation was reluctant very disfavorable thereafter. the hotel cactus is aptly named! It hurts to settle there. to avoid absolutely! !
__label__strneg I did not see a rat, but as many rat traps in the halls to the rooms, it does not put in trust! I never had the courage to sit on the chair or the bedspread or walk barefoot on the carpet.
__label__strneg go your way! Dirty hotel, not heated at the November self and the receptionist has me mugged ...
__label__strneg we booked through the internet a few days ago and when we arrived there was a mistake booking, we had to transfer to the opposite hotel which was not more welcoming. Same receptionist for both hotels, so there was no one when we arrived.
__label__strneg hotel to avoid absolutely! do n't go there , if you 're from abroad the reception are going to be so ugly that you 're stay in france will be a nightmare ... .. ! deplorable home, 3 receptionists, 3 employees that annoy you heavily! Lost keys, change your room, wake up at 8 am They enter your room and are not happy to find you there! , private conversations while you wait (yes but she stops the pizza is over ...) we warn you if there is no one at the reception is that it is in the bathroom and that it can last long ... . Are they so poorly paid that the money was used to pass this potentially 1 star falsely 3 to avoid carefully, there are plenty of other hotel far better and mins expensive! !
__label__strneg a good hotel to recommend. very nice welcome, good information, the proximity to the porte de Versailles and montparnasse train station make it an excellent base.
__label__strneg welcoming and friendly. no problem . propreté r.a.s.
__label__strneg sometimes, nothing goes! I missed the last train to Nantes, so I find myself spending the night in this ibis hotel next to the train station. 180 € all the same, for an ibis it hurts, but it's paris ... after a few minutes, I realize that a blower emanating from the air conditioning system is very noisy and especially does not stop , even when cutting the heating. moments later, I realize that regular whirring tremble my room the metro! (I was on the ground floor.) it is written everywhere; we are committed to finding a solution to your problems in 15 minutes quot; . so I go to the home so they stop this blower no idea why the how, and no technician available. so I stayed with my problem. it is also written snacks 24/24 with a tempting card as I had to work, I opt for this option. I will order at the reception, and there the anguish oula that we have not, that we have not, sorry ah I think we have not ... in short they had a hot dish and a yogurt from breakfast to me to propose . So shit night when you hold us! thank you ibis
__label__strneg to avoid . very expensive and personal at the reception very unpleasant.
__label__strneg room small and noisy. welcome without explanation, hardly hello.
__label__strneg hotel very nice and very convenient because located less than 150 meters from the montparnasse station! the reception is very warm! I highly recommend it
__label__strneg I do not like the bed. it was small for 2 people
__label__strneg Blah, apart from the bathroom which was redone but very cramped, the decor of the room and the hotel rather passed. the sheets and blankets no freshness, on the contrary. greeted by the receptionist who ironed sheets and towels in the entrance / small lounge. a mini fridge in the room but that does not work. positive point its location in the heart of montparnasse district.
__label__strneg I stayed three nights from April 10, 2013 to April 13, 2013 at the hotel clairefontaine rue fermat, the first two nights as a professional and the third privately. Arriving on April 10 late, I found that the ramp inside the stairs (which must be borrowed because there is no elevator) is poorly fixed and even not fixed. I also found as the previous user that the soundproofing was very bad but the tenants realized this defect and were very quiet. the reservation had been made (by booking for the first night then by phone for the next two nights) in a very friendly way, the location of the host is very convenient between montparnasse and denfert, two floors of the hotel form a very nice patio very nice when it is beautiful, the room I occupied the third was very clean and very spacious, the bed was very good. the hotel was redone two years ago it seems and I had already spotted (in case the 2 hotels where I usually stay, much cheaper, are taken) because the rue fermat is very quiet. my shower was leaking and creating an unpleasant noise. One of the hotel patrons told me (helping me to make a coffee) that the water temperature of his shower was impossible to adjust. On the 11th in the morning I absolutely had to have breakfast at 7:00. bread, coffee and croissants were only available at 7.18. on the 12th in the evening when I returned I noticed that my room had not been made. On the morning of the 13th, I did not pay attention to the fact that 3 breakfasts had been counted whereas I had only consumed 2 of them. the bill was however drawn up according to my request in two parts, the Friday being apart. on the morning of the 13th, the cafe's coffee was cold. the reception person kindly but unsuccessfully attempted to operate one of the coffee machines. so I had tea. When I came back for my baggage on the evening of the 13th, I pointed out these problems to the person at the reception who seems to be the person in charge. he simply answered me in a way that surprised me so much that I did not reply quot; I know all that. it does not matter . we depend on bakers for bread and croissant. a room not made once in three nights it happens. quot; the person refunded the extra breakfast without comment or goodbye. that there are problems in a hotel that is possible and may be due to buildings, repairs, materials and staff. a hotel is a difficult business to manage and everything is not perfect in the material world ... I understand all this and it is explicable. but let the customer be told quot; it's not serious quot; That is to say, why do you make a story that reflects a contempt of the client that is incompatible with the hotel business that must be based on hospitality. all this is a shame because for 110 euros breakfast 10 euros it seems to me that the defects that I reported (breakfast not ready, problematic showers, room not made) should be the subject of corrective action as soon as possible. I am sorry to have to write such a harsh comment, it never happened to me, but the way my comments were handled at the hotel compels me to do so. jean-rené kerjean
__label__strneg good value for money and quiet and a good welcome a hearty breakfast
__label__strneg no parking . 1h to go around in circles to find places. forgetting the delivery of the evening meal, obliged to call back. the seven burger is the charal burger large supermarket to put 40 seconds in the microwave (I know him well) with a bit of low-end chips. The ambience of the levitation room is good but the rooms are very small. shower friendly but no separation between the bathroom and the room. chaste couples abstain. good breakfast with choice of delivery time. we had a good time in love but we will not come back.
__label__strneg clean, but old, poorly insulated, super noisy (no wifi! pity because 2 steps from the Montparnasse district.
__label__strneg the hotel of the green mill in paris surprised me by its conviviality. it is simple but comfortable, good mattress, silent, friendly service and smiling. to summarize the hotel of the green mill is to know for all those who must make a stopover in this district of paris.
__label__strneg nice decor but small room, half-clogged shower and hairdryer hs.
__label__strneg my favorite hotel chain, for my work travels, I always look at home first. best western combines tradition and modernity, great value for money, comfortable rooms, and friendly staff. I highly recommend .
__label__strneg Friendly hotel, attentive and helpful staff, breakfast very good. only defect the walls in quot; paper quot; you hear too much noise in the adjoining rooms.
__label__strneg fred'hotel, very welcoming and calm, to go down there is to feel in family. I have known him for 33 years. thank you vidal and at one of these days, good luck.
__label__strneg hotel very good location very good staff and a receptionist very very nice and attentive to customers ... hotel very cheap and with comfort! very good hotel not expensive ... i do not understand the other reviews of other cilents who are not satisfied fu the hotel i think they are a little demanding. ... but for me it recommended with eyes closed. thank you all the team of the hotel.
__label__strneg Not good for one to two nights. shower a little noisy. no hook in the room to hang towels. otherwise c nice.
__label__strneg dirty bad welcome lil dej restricted
__label__strneg beautiful family room. the service is a little soft to `home and on the floors ...
__label__strneg Staff quite warm and welcoming, good quality room, average quality but interesting price. good overall experience the receptionist gave me several leaflets and even helped me to get a metro ticket so that I could go to the Louvre.
__label__strneg Staff not nice and not friendly we have the impression to disturb them. the rooms are ... tired or even ... vents clogged with scotch ... dirty wallpapers ..., there is no other words, breakfasts take it anywhere but not there. ..
__label__strneg The common circulatiosn are a little tired but the rooms have every comfort and are very clean. the decor is pretty good. As there are only 3 tables for breakfast, I recommend the bakery / tea room down the street, cheaper and copious.
__label__strneg very good value for money..very nice room breakfast .. buffet at will ..room clean ..wifi free ds all the hotel, smiling home, listening and especially very helpful.
__label__strneg cramped room under the stairs, space reduced to the bare minimum ... for one night, alone, it passes ...
__label__strneg the critics fuse side clientel. as an artist, it's not better. the director is antipatic, he tuts without asking, and to top it off, he never paid us our intervention.
__label__strneg the picnic was good
__label__strneg Hotel quite small but very well placed (in the center of Paris). we had breakfast there, it was decent. pity the elevator is so small but apparently hard to do otherwise.
__label__strneg it's a shame how can you sell nights in these conditions! I was late posting my opinion since it took me 3 days to recover in sleep. we arrive at the hotel welcome, I open the door of the room, first surprise the photos of the site should not be contractual because there was no relation to the pictures seen on the site. Second observation, everyone could not have resided there, only small people and small weights could access the toilet and shower. but the worst moment for me was that of sleeping a mattress with a huge hole in the center certainly due to the many passages. having got up in the morning at 04h I thought I was going to fall like a mass but with the condition of this mattress I am gone for a long night's sleep ... hell went on with the coffee or beverage machine who was standing in front of my door, needless to say how nice it is at 3am to hear a customer serving himself, or the sound of refrigera- tion getting on the road every few hours. and then miracle, I fell asleep under the soft rocking of the neighbor's snoring. 8:30 standing, go to the shower, must take a positive attitude and forget that hot water should be optional! I swore to leave my opinion on the site, it is the flight is tired of paying for it to have. room 102 stay from 17 to 18 september
__label__strneg it is a trap that I do not recommend you to suffer 1. the elevator is on the 3rd floor the other feet even if you have a big suitcase 2 the television does not work 3 icing on the cake a ceaseless noise all night the engine of the elevator. and this for a 3 star at 120 € per night! bravo ! have a good word hello!
__label__strneg very good hotel, where the rooms are well decorated, there is also a very good restaurant integret at this hotel. the staff is very friendly and very kind.
__label__strneg this hotel has ruined my entire living room with a laptop; a sofa ; a fixed computer; Chair and ceiling as the hotel leaked water from one of their tubs and this water went through the ceiling and rotted the entire living room for 15 days as I was on vacation. (I live just below the hotel).
__label__strneg good hotel 2 steps from lyon station small room but very clean, the wifi worked well the staff is very helpful and informed us quot quot;
__label__strneg waitresses not nice, sandwich poorly done, order not respected, full bins ...
__label__strneg hotel convenient because close to the station of lyon. the rooms are small but clean and well insulated from the outside noise but not the noise inside. more light from the corridor is lit all night, which is seen through the door of the room. the breakfast room is too small and the service is slow. moreover it's not a buffet. short hotel correct for a short stay.
__label__strneg ch 51 75 € (out of season) value for money more than correct, new bathroom with large shower and separate toilet. the room is clean and bright. the staff is welcoming. only worries we hear a lot of noise from the corridor and the bathroom next door ... I recommend
__label__strneg very good hotel and great hospitality.
__label__strneg a hotel located next to the train station of lyon which is good when you have very heavy luggage! you can eat in the bastille (5 minutes walk) or there is a little all the restaurants and for all tastes! the location for breakfast deserves to be a little more spacious, because sometimes you have to wait in case of high attendance.
__label__strneg this hotel is brand new. the receptionist told me they had opened in 2012. the colors red and white are very pretty. the staff are helpful, they even offered me a coffee. I will return with my eyes closed!
__label__strneg a hotel where the men go to deceive their wives.
__label__strneg good memories in this menagerie.
__label__strneg I arrived January 1, 2009 in Paris at your hotel where I received room 156 a real cooler everything was cold in the room the dras dansle beds too. Before leaving the hotel for dinner we announced at the reception the case but the night we spent in a cold room we feel that the staff of the hotel was aware of this room and also the noise next to the lift and piping. Sunday, January 4 at breakfast at 9:30 there were more croissants nor Viennese to believe that the person in charge of the morning (lamb) does not have the responsibilities that one entrusts him no competence.
__label__strneg correct but narrow. difficult to get into the shower.
__label__strneg Very good value for money . Very nice home . very clean . to recommend .
__label__strneg this quot; hotel quot; had to be nice enough just after its construction, unfortunately it falls into ruin. my remarks relate to room 10 (I have not seen others) _it is stains on the carpet, on the walls, and under the mattress (I wished I had looked) _the window does not lock (it opens if you pull it, even when it is supposed to be locked) _a single power socket _big sealing problem in the shower on the wall that separates the bathroom from the bedroom, at the level of shower but room side, the wallpaper is peeling off and the wall is black mold. _the faucet of the bathroom sink does not correctly adjust the temperature of the water, so it's impossible to have only cold water _the support above the sink (to put the cup , the toothbrush, ...) comes off, it should not be long to fall - the bar fixed to the wall between the sink and the bathroom (to hang on a towel) also stands out - there are several large cigarette holes in the shower curtain _the showerhead is broken, the water fuse in two perpendicular directions _il is no more ceiling under the shower, so we can see that the real ceiling composed of crumbling concrete, and iron bars completely rusted. the _the sheets were clean _8 tv channels (tf1, fr2, fr3, fr5, frô, tmc, nrj12, lcp) _55 € for a room with private shower, 2min walk from the station of lyon, we can not say that it is expensive.
__label__strneg Really disappointed with this stay, I do not recommend this hotel. After persistent problems with the magnetic card, I was woken up in the middle of the night by the roommate which I felt he was going to get into my room because the walls were badly insulated. the staff was not very friendly or present and the facilities are a little outdated (including the elevator).
__label__strneg very mediocre reception, elevator down without staff explanation, noise infernal room overlooking the street, many problems with magnetization cards opening rooms and intrusion of person in the middle of the night in the room while we had a card passes room bath in bad condition and equipment (broken toilet bezel that we had to replace inadmissible!) only advantage close to a metro station high price compared to services
__label__strneg chgt of owners. the old bouiboui has become a brewery. Good place and what I ate there was good.
__label__strneg excellent brewery with fine and fresh products, with a very friendly service.
__label__strneg Friendly staff, except the manager. the manager is unfriendly to the possible, scornful and rude. he speaks very badly to his staff. the site forgets to indicate that customers can be changed places 3 times the buffet incomprehensibly.
__label__strneg problem of reservations not retained
__label__strneg good restaurant located near the metro. very fast service. very very beautiful orchid. good atmosphere, very nice server. we were offered sake with a little surprise at the bottom of the glass for men and women! !
__label__strneg Terrible bedding! 150 € to have the ratings bumped by the springs of a bed that had to know the war!
__label__strneg deco viellotte, stained carpet, wall sconce that quot; pend quot; dangerous! cupboard door not flowing; ; ; no hot water 'december'; independent of their will (problem on the network due to the snow: no compensation possible, barely courteous staff only positive point, quiet room, poorly done household very disappointed do not recommend ... ...
__label__strneg this hotel dates back to 1870 and is still owned by the same family. this hotel has no star because it does not want it. he prefers anonymity and cultivates anonymous hospitality. he is held by a superb girl who has a splendid son.
__label__strneg hotel located in a district to discover paris and near the station of lyon! very good hotel for a two star! to advise for cheap stopover in the capital!
__label__strneg Beautiful rooms, a newly refurbished hotel, everything was there for a good stay. Only downside, the breakfast was 100000 places of a Parisian breakfast ... no croissant. we had the right to bread and crackers, too bad ... the corner is very nice, no law bercy village and a metro train!
__label__strneg welcomes and very warm atmosphere, the service is fast however, their coffee is still a little elevated, the neighborhood remains charmingand sympathetic. ké coffee staff are awesome, it guides us to choose, and shares good delights
__label__strneg home more than mediocre, dirty room ...
__label__strneg there is a bedroom which is located on the ground floor behind the lobby. you have no privacy, the bathroom being adjoining. if it has been redone and great, we really hear everything, all the comings and goings during the night, it's a nightmare! moreover the hotel is under construction (January 2013), the reception is in a deplorable state. upstairs the rooms are tiny, and depending on what you book, you do not have bathroom or toilet.
__label__strneg warm welcome in this Thai spa that does not look from the outside. attentive masseuse, very attentive, intense relaxation. place to recommend.
__label__strneg 3 nights on site air-conditioned rooms, quiet (double windows). breakfast is quot; passable quot; (bad coffee) a good compromise nevertheless for a few days in Paris. take a walk through the small neighborhood behind the second street on the right, going right, to the poplar postern. dine next door at the right time, you will not regret it.
__label__strneg bedding in poor condition, the room is small, the staff is nonchalant and little involved (wait 20 minutes at breakfast for bread). the worst probably the hotel is dirty, the bathroom in the room and the pool area too! in short, I absolutely do not advise if the location is ideal
__label__strneg with my friend, we spent a week at this hotel due to very limited budget. the rooms are old and poorly decorated with carpet / wallpaper torn. you have to pay extra to use the shower down the hall. the reception is sometimes average. the cleaning is not very well done but the sheets are clean. the bedding is very bad, with spring beds that hurt your back. attention all week, we were devoured by parasites (bedbugs) that were likely in the mattress of the bed. In short, we were anxious to leave this hotel, which we do not recommend to spend more than a night or two.
__label__strpos very well located, near the eiffel tower, in a quiet area very clean welcome
__label__strpos the outdated side of this hotel could give it a nice charm if not the welcome of a pitt bull at the front desk (on my arrival anyway). hotel clean and well placed. tarif correct . correct breakfast. I will look for another hotel before booking again in this one.

__label__strpos near the Gallo-Roman thermal baths of the left bank and in the heart of the Saint Germain des Pres district, the spa 28 is nestled in the vaulted cellars of an 18th century building, which houses the Prince Regent residence hotel. by pushing the door of the spa 28, you discover a pleasant place where the essential oils enchant you ... but the magic is not there, you will have to go down the stairs to discover the magic of this place where the decoration and the zen atmosphere invite you to tranquility and relaxation. this spa invites you to travel to the heart of cultures and ancestral knowledge practiced throughout the world. the products used are 100 natural and body care are presented to you in the form of dead sea rituals, africa, medina, indonesia, japan, etc. Whichever style you choose, you will enjoy a scrub, a wrap and a massage. facials, also in the form of rituals, are available in prestigious treatments for a bespoke beauty. for men, specific treatments are adapted to men's skin and their needs (skin cleansing, anti-fatigue, revitalizing ...) in this spa, water is used as a therapeutic virtue. each treatment is preceded by a relaxation session in the steam room, a swim in the pool or the possibility of taking advantage of the hot tubs in the jacuzzi.

__label__strpos I loved the tea room at Charlotte, located on the ground floor of the Hotel Academies and Arts, Metro Vavin. the 3 rooms that compose it are all very pretty, each with a different atmosphere. everything is both classy and cozy. the service is impeccable, probably because of the 3 stars of the hotel which makes people caring. the teas are from the tea palace brand (4.5 euros tea), and you can take macaroons stone shut up (picasso macaroon). icing on the cake, there is no big-world, which is nice.

__label__strpos excellent location ...
__label__strpos small hotel value for money. rooms cramped but clean and comfortable beds. friendly welcome, breakfast served in the room on request. try to take advantage of advantageous promotions because the standard prices tend to be high for the size of the rooms. Nice neighborhood in front of a police station (but not too noisy).
__label__strpos Positive hotel well placed, metro station 100 m. very quiet street. the rooms are clean, well soundproofed and the bedding is very correct. breakfast for 8 euros per pers is ok. negatives the director wants the payment of the room upon your arrival attention contrary to what is announced, no hair dryer in the room. limited services but only 2 star hotel! conclusion good value for a hotel in paris

__label__strpos very good value for money 70 € per night for studio 2 people clean and spacious very good reception private parking of the hotel in the basement at attractive price 10 € / day metro and bus nearby we did not have breakfast at 8 € because fully equipped room (kitchenette with fridge, microwave, coffee maker, dishes ...) and bakery 20 m. I recommend
__label__strpos I think 160 € for a night is more than exaggerated knowing that the bed is not even good
__label__strpos Small clean hotel but double bed not large enough for 2 people. it is better to privilege the rooms on street (not very noisy). staff at the professional reception. However, room rates far too high or excessive for the quality of rooms, the situation in Paris and the services offered.
__label__strpos arrival in the room not done household, condom under the bed, string in the shower, tumblers users, wet towel ... obliged to change rooms and no commercial gesture from the hotel. We expect a minimum of quality in an ibis hotel, which I clearly have not found in this one.
__label__strpos very friendly hotel and good value for money
__label__strpos this hotel is located really near the place de la Bastille but especially near the palace bercy (in the 12th), which is very convenient when you come for one of its events (we came to Paris for a concert) . our stay was very good, we were welcomed very warmly, and slept very well. an address that I advise.
__label__strpos the rooms great owl but a little small .... the neighborhood is cool and quite calm. and people of the hotel are hypersympa ....
__label__strpos Economically affordable, I made a 2 night stay in early October. housed in a single room on the 3rd floor, overlooking the corner of rue gossec and rue de picpus. calm and pleasant environment. good reception at the reception. renovated room, with all the necessary furniture, closet, desk, a bathroom (provide his soap and shower gel ^^) and toilet. good wi-fi connections in the hotel, flat screen tv. no breakfast or catering, but we find happiness on the boulevard dosmenyl or by going on the golden door. When I was there, the hotel was still undergoing renovations and the elevators were being installed.
__label__strpos warm welcome, attentive masseuses, well-kept places, the scenery of thailand ... and all for a very good price ... why not
__label__strpos for the price, it's really ok. room very small but nothing to complain about, clean. Bathroom really small not ideal when you are big (or fat). central taps (sink and shower) not perfect, but ok ... for 1 or 2 nights max. and just to sleep from 23h to 7h. again, very good value for money.
__label__strpos a very well located hotel that I frequent regularly for almost 10 years. I still knew him before the renovation. never disappointed and always very welcome. the rooms are small but clean. the showers upstairs are good and clean. nothing to say . breakfast good and you can eat at will. I recommend this hotel to 100 and I'm going back again this summer
__label__strpos super stay. Great bathrooms. excellent bedding. quiet . friendly staff. pdj complete. pity that it is often full, must be booked in advance if possible
__label__strpos a week passed indeed just for sleeping. no tv in the rooms, .repas of the evening limit, no choice so meal taken outside.
