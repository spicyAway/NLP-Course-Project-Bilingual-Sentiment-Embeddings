Truly unbelievable
very good and hearty brunch on sunday for 28 €
inadmissible !
I booked by phone by communicating my credit card number. I booked for 2 nights then canceled for one of the two nights the morning of the reservation, and the card was still charged without my agreement for two nights. the interview with the owner was unpleasant, and this person told me that on his website it is written that you must cancel 48 hours in advance, which is wrong if you visit their site. it's limited in terms of honesty.
great location great location to visit paris.
ideal location to visit paris. beautiful discovery in the heart of the marsh.
well located near Place des Vosges (5 minutes walk).
this hotel did not hesitate to dislodge us from our room and give it to someone who wanted to take it longer. they are interested only in the money you give them and certainly not in the service they can provide you ...
Exceptional reception by the bald species at the entrance ... impossibility to visit the rooms. this place has really avoided. ( please avoid this hotel , you won't be welcome ) .
we spent 3 1/2 days at this hotel and we are very dissatisfied. we arrive and we are told that we only have the room at around 1:30 pm while we are typing a trip of 800 terminals with a baby and two big sports bag, so we have to leave the bags to the Home . then we come back and ask if the bed for the little one was installed not at all forget, so we go up and wait, we open it and the bed on one side is very dirty, they did not even try to clean it before bringing it to us. the room is tiny and rather unhealthy. the tapestry comes from another time, the walls are cracked, the sink without a cap, the shower bachet where the grill is removed so you risk losing a jewel easily, in the evening it puts the heating thoroughly, the TV channels are mottled, even the toilets have an anomaly, we shoot the hunt with scrap metal, there is no protective plastic and many more on the room we had. we are up four floors with a baby, one of the Rails of the two stairs move, the carpet comes off in places. the water we have a lot of trouble to solve it, for a moment it goes the minute later we can burn his child which almost happened with my daughter. they say on their website that the internet terminal is free fake the 15min = 2 € and so on. The facade is a good impression of a good hotel but inside the floors is unimaginable. we got room 411 and we did not see other rooms by the way, there is a big difference. it is to believe that they give the right rooms to foreigners to give a good image of their hotel. the only positives are breakfast in the room even if it is € 6.50, you can eat what you want and it is between 7am and 11am. and where it is located, you can quickly access the subway or the station of lyon. the reception is average except for the young woman of the entry and the kindness of the housewives. it is a place where we will not set foot. between price and quality there is a big difference. yet we are not a difficult couple but there, we could not move in the room, it would stick the cot against ours so that the girl does not bang her head against the cabinet slightly protruding from the wall of the wall 2 times she hurt herself. On the internet we ask for a double room with cot, and we are refused for a triple room with cot, so we ended up with three beds adult 2 beds to make a bed for 2, plus the cot. it is misery this room. We said for the bed and they left it anyway, so we made it to my sister in law who was also in Paris. but the rooms are small. the doors of the shower, do not be big and for children you would have to buy an inflatable tub I will bring my daughter for a future trip to avoid any surprises of this style. Even calling from the hotel is expensive, my husband called me exactly 34 seconds to tell me he was at the hotel 1,2 € communication. Anyway, I do not know about you, but we were very very disappointed with this hotel.
Cheap little neighborhood hotel and great location.
a nice hotel from the point of view of its Haussmann style, quot; quot; old paris quot; quot; like all Parisian buildings with sculptures in rooms with a beautiful exterior façade. we stayed with my husband 5 wonderful nights in a cute room, we sleep well, calm reigns well in this small family hotel, bed very comfortable and renewed. we were spoiled by the team because the breakfast is served in our room every morning at 8am at our request the day before. if you wish to have a good parisian stay in a charming parisian hotel do not hesitate to go to hotel baudin. Even in the rooms, they make us remember that we are in Paris because there are beautiful paintings of old Paris ... great stay at Hotel Baudin. thank you for the welcome and attention that the staff has given us. hotel to recommend.
I stayed at this hotel and had all my money stolen in my suitcase during the few hours I was out for dinner. And yet, I asked the receptionist if the hotel could give me access to a safe but she said it was quot; broken quot; . my room was neither forced nor the affairs of my suitcase well folded. the next day, I ask to have access to surveillance cameras but the hotel refuses on the pretext that the manager is traveling and that only he has access to the surveillance office. the police obviously did nothing and the receptionist kept the money stolen! !
super friendly hotel, top staff and super lively and central neighborhood ... highly recommend
very good couscous ... at the restaurant.
good but poorly soundproof ...
ideal for a concert at bercy for example. very welcome, possibility of requesting an extra bed in the event of an unforeseen event, for an additional 20 €. a watchman is present at night to give us the keys if 'we come back too late ... or too early! clean rooms (in the opinion of an asthmatic!) , bathroom also (no mold, etc.). near metro
strongly advise against! very unpleasant home, no customer service, resa by phone not competent request to call back later 3 times in a row ... bedding uncomfortable, staff not nice!
stay of 6 nights, room very badly soundproofed, very small, tiny bathroom, doors of rooms which slam.
if you do not mind the lack of balcony, the quite lack of drawers, that the wardrobe is very small and night table very small too (it only serves a book and is not supported well), for you hear the neighbors, the narrow spaces, the very low lighting, a bed of soft bed that plunges into bed, only in the morning hot water, great distance from the center of the city so truly it is a very good hotel! good breakfast, excellent cleanliness, excellent service.
the hotel bel air is hotel genial surtut right now it is 5 star mode there are great rooms that they are clean and very well rengées from the first day with very nice housewives and if you are too kind with them at the returns you will have gifts.
Very friendly cafe, the owner is a very friendly and nice man who easily befriends students. Also the rates are not excessive, and there are discounts for students, for that it is enough just to get his drink at the counter.
very friendly staff and friendly the room is comfortable and pleasant the deco is nice breakfast is good and a wide choice goes to us we were perif side and we were not disanger by the sound of the car sound insulation y and very pleasant the hotel is ideally placed for the person who will have to go to the salons which propose to him as the salons of the photo we were 350 m
very good, breakfast. Hamam very well. room a bit small but very nice bathroom. friendly staff. close to public transport.
not bad for a short stay! its advantage is its proximity to the city center and all the places that deserve to be visited in Paris ... the bathroom is brand new nickel! I think it has been refurbished recently. I am currently there and there is no need to complain ...
a good little hotel near the center
it is a good hotel.
terrible! reservation made and settled via expedition pro. for starters, the receptionist can not find my reservation. after 10 minutes he found it on the pretext that my name was misspelled what is required booking from my usual account. then he argues that the breakfasts are not included in my price and insists that I pay on arrival and the tourist tax of 2 €. while in all hotels these fees are charged at check-out. it's not like the room is not already paid. I had to turn on my computer and show him my booking email to prove my good time! the rooms are very poorly soundproofed. nothing will be spared. the snoring of the neighbor (and more) and especially the subway and its audio messages just opposite until 2 o'clock in the morning. young tourists next door we party until 5am in the morning loud music and laughter nightclub way. the staff could not fault it. neither the room service that regularly supplied the party, nor the receptionist who was called by an excessed neighbor who was offered to refund his room! as for breakfast, the buffet was empty of 8 hours. no more pastries or ham, and a background of orange juice. the staff was more busy arguing (about to fight) than refueling the buffet. icing on the cake, I am asked to pay my tourist tax when I leave! the receptionist did not notice that I paid at check-in. I did not have the pettiness to ask for a receipt for 2 €, I'll have! in the positives (though) hotel redone and clean. ok rooms and wide shower. excellently located right in front of the subway in a busy area.
very good, pretty, not very expensive!
this hotel is charming but we were very disappointed because they have a fixed date to turn on the heating and will not derogate even if it is very cold in the rooms! we left with a good cold ... moreover the owner of the hotel was very unpleasant to us.
Staff super friendly and very friendly, the rooms are very comfortable. a good place to stay and hard to leave, I made so many friends (es) so much the staff and the customers are endearing. it's a big heart that I'll leave this little world. to use without moderation ! Diseases.
wrong hotel i booked 1month before i call back 48 hours before the date the day i deposited my luggage at 8am before going to my meeting when i arrived at 6pm my luggage was still in the middle of lobby and the receptionist announces to have a problem with my room and my reserved a room in another hotel has 15mn fortunately I did not arrive at 21h
the aramis hotel is really a great hotel in paris, cheap and well placed. try it!
top for a romantic getaway .... or a drink in the private garden ...
180 th at night a shame for this cesspool!
a very tasteful decoration
restaurant very nice or the service is warm and the decor rather pleasant! the atmosphere is however a little snobby on the edges! in terms of cleanliness I have nothing to say, the whole is much more than correct! highly recommended
good room except the bathroom and not too expensive for a night with a girl
very nice view of paris. to visit .
