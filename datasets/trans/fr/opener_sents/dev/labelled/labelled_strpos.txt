__label__strpos very nice hotel, the price is seen in the quality of the service and the place. ideally located in the center, the street does not look mine but the interior is very nice. if you are passing through paris and want to relax in a chic and well located, this hotel is for you!

__label__strpos No sound insulation between rooms, it is a shame to pay 230 euros and not to sleep ... minimalist rooms and finishes that leave something to be desired (a bulb hs. hanging wires). the TV is of a mediocre quality ... we get to sleep better in a formula 1 ...

__label__strpos The hotel is a classic chain, but the neighborhood is very friendly and lively, multicultural. the hotel is therefore very well placed

__label__strpos simple and affordable, clean and quiet the wifi and more.

__label__strpos this hotel is advertised as three stars far from offering services on this level the rooms are extremely small and inconsistent with the photos, the bathroom far from resembling a bathroom of a three star hotel with not even the usual products such as shower gel and shampoo which are still a minimum and when at breakfast it is a strict minimum. the fact that it is included in the price of the room does not imply that it must be the strict minimum with just a mini chocolate bread, croissant and apple slipper lost in a pantry. If I had to give a score of 0 to 10 to this hotel, I will give it 4. and I will strongly cancel it to my friends.

__label__strpos nice hotel, reasonable price, good reception, lunch ok

__label__strpos just quot; the carillon quot; what)

__label__strpos value for money interesting!

__label__strpos comfortable hotel. well located for those who like to discover paris on foot. nice home. parking (fee) and metro nearby. the rooms are simple but the beds comfortable. the neighborhood is calm. the Boulevard boulevard is full of restaurants of all styles, the large rex is a few hundred meters. i discovered this hotel in 2006 thanks to the quot; backpacker's guide quot; I went back this year, I was going to a show at Bercy ... which is only 15 minutes by subway.

__label__strpos very nice home, very good value for money

__label__strpos hotel very good, quality of rooms and hospitality perfect) the service is very attentive and quality. this hotel is in the line of the best western brand. to advise the price is quite high but the service is good ....

__label__strpos very nice room, modern, close to 3 subway lines. To advice

__label__strpos impeccable situation in the heart of paris in front of a vélib station and subway, everything is the welcome, cleanliness, charm of the marsh a hotel in Paris (without the noise) with the magic of a Parisian interior. thank you for the stay

__label__strpos I did not stay in the hotel but the small bar in the hotel is exceptional. the cocktails are really good and the waiters very friendly. the place is looking for calm, so ideal to have a drink for two after a dinner in the neighborhood.

__label__strpos a small hotel with charm very discreet but exceptional. amazing architectural proposal around a courtyard that offers calm. the cozy bar offers trendy cocktails. to follow the events throughout the year photo exhibitions, private parties, Christmas market or very private screenings. the little extra it is not necessary to rent a room to make a visit to this little haven.

__label__strpos a place that is starting to be fashionable. in a surprising area, you can not imagine 1) a small square and 2) such a place, hotel and restaurant at this place. but already, arriving, we realize that we are not the only ones ... and the servers are totally overwhelmed. wine side, the selection is interesting even if limited enough eventually. flat side, we do not understand quickly how it works. we are told things to share, and then finally no, and finally yes. in any case, fried squid are delicious and crispy. very good scallops and pork too. a good address but no doubt it will be necessary to allow time for the first visitors to get tired to find a little peace in this place

__label__strpos how not to rush to edgar when the sun comes up. their terrace is just magic. in addition the dishes are very good. at noon or in the evening, this place is very pleasant. only detail, pre-do a little in advance because you will not be alone on the spot.

__label__strpos a very nice place, with its beautiful terrace overlooking a small square. the dining room is very well decorated, in blue and gold, which offers a warm atmosphere instead. On the other hand, I thought the food was expensive! some dishes are to share and yet they are not necessarily easy dishes to share. the food is ok but nothing more, some dishes are good, others very disappointing ... the service is impeccable and very effective! I am so disappointed with the cuisine and the price. I would stay again so maybe just for a drink!

__label__strpos I agree with the comments below! this hotel is shocking, disgusting and very very expensive! Spend your money on people who want to work well! i agree with the comments below . this hotel is disgusting and very expensive . i would recommend to spend your money somewhere else . those people do n't like doing their job well !

__label__strpos charming home. the suite was beautiful and what a beautiful bathtub! to try in love. everything is new and beautiful.

__label__strpos correct home. However, we have recovered a room overlooking the street whose soundproofing proved to be very insufficient, especially on Saturday evening where I had the impression to find myself a good part of the night to the circles of the party-goers who meet on the small square at 100m with music and cries of jubilant loudly.

__label__strpos hotel rather nice despite room service a bit slow. otherwise the restaurant is fine without more and the price of the room is ok to spend the night. the shower is great in the room. and the beds are comfortable

__label__strpos Better pay more than risk coming to this hotel. blanket, room not cleaned (a handkerchief under the bed), the sheets seem changed and the trash emptied, but it is the bare minimum. a teenager would do better his room. yes it's cheap in one sense, but it's theft in another, because they do not even the bare minimum in terms of hygiene.

__label__strpos hello we had the privilege to be the first to sign the guestbook of the hotel o)) we had a great stay in this hotel located close to the place of the republic (well, we it was still under construction last December!) . the rooms are modern, the staff is very caring and hamam very nice after a day of walking ... we recommend this hotel and it is on we will return ...

__label__strpos very good welcome in the hotel, nice breakfast at 5.50 €, you can leave your luggage arriving until time of departure without additional costs. the staff is friendly, moreover it is open 24/24 the hotel is easily accessible by metro and all near the major stations. it is not the luxury but very correct for the price.

__label__strpos hotel quiet and well kept but there is a black dot breakfast is to say the least old ... we could hope for this price something a little more consistent! ...

__label__strpos Hotel dilapidated, particularly noisy with a staff little involved a-me-foutiste ... mattress in bowl, remote control hs, breakfast avave in the basement and minimalist. services quot; offered quot; displayed in room not held ... in short if you can choose another address do not hesitate! !

__label__strpos room infested with bed flea or other bedbug.

__label__strpos the ice betting operation at City Hall is great for people who can not go on vacation. by installing on the forecourt an outdoor rink for adults and small is great. it is the happiness of all lovers of skiing more than the access to ice rinks is free and skate rental is 5 € v really to do

__label__strpos just delicious, one thing is certain every euro spent is more than justified. pleasant setting, pampering service, and just perfect kitchen not to be missed.

__label__strpos one of the most beautiful mansion of paris. built between 1625 and 1630 by jean androuet of the hoop. bought in 1634 by the duke of sully. very good bookstore specialized on the capital. garden giving access to the Vosges after a short break on a bench.

__label__strpos nice visits to see again. visit with the association of paris in 4 (75004). go there preferably on Saturday morning around 10am which allows you to have lunch in the neighborhood after visiting the garden. and if it's nice to sit on a bench.

__label__strpos great location, very welcome, clean. ideal to discover Paris.

__label__strpos Cheap, well located, but disappointing comfort and service compared to what is presented on the very (very) beautiful website. just opposite excellent Korean restaurant!

__label__strpos small teasing "inside, the traveler gets to know the rooms. for example, the "Crystal Queen" is a room thought like a fairy cave, studded with Swarovski crystals. the "enchanted forest" is a room marked by the universe of shadow theater of childhood, a magical place populated by imaginary animals, trees, leaves ... "a real dreamlike and unusual place in paris.

__label__strpos Establishment with elegant simplicity, the montana restaurant offers every Sunday a brunch of quality, and this from 11:00 to 14:30. Turning to the French tradition, you can eventually enjoy brunch, accompanied by quality cheese, including fresh cheese with red berries, followed by its exquisite Corsican cured meats.

__label__strpos the hotel tamaris is an excellent hotel quality price for paris. pleasant stay.

__label__strpos I had the opportunity to spend two nights in this hotel for a business trip and I must say that I was perfectly satisfied. Firstly worried about the reviews on booking, I must say that I for my part had an excellent stay the rooms are spacious (Parisian hotel), the staff friendly and helpful, the hotel very beautiful and design. the breakfast was excellent (a lot of variety, nice room, quality products) and I must say that I was expecting more than 13 euros for a 4 star hotel in Paris! I usually stay at Best Western hotels, so I recommend this one at 100. moreover it is well located 4 minutes from the metro bel air on the 6th and close to the line 1, and a lot of commerce / restaurant nearby.

__label__strpos I recommend ! hotel completely renovated in a quiet area, rare in Paris. in addition to their launch, they make promotional rates ...
