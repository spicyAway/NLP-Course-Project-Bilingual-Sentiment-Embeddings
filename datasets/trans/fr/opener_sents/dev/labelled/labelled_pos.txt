__label__pos disappointing ! tiny room, without television. the full price of the stay is required upon arrival. In addition, on the last day, an unbearable smell of cigarette reigned in the room.

__label__pos Place filled with greenery and a beautiful fountain in the heart of Paris, the Place des Vosges is a must for walks. placed in the heart of the marai, this place will offer you the expected shade in summer thanks to its many trees all around the place.

__label__pos nice hotel with underground parking. there is possibility to have breakfast on the spot. the price is a bit expensive but the rooms are nice. it is located in a neighborhood not far from cafes, nightclubs. every Thursday morning there is a big market next to the place de la Bastille! !

__label__pos good reception, efficient receptionist is good advice. room simply but elegantly decorated. price related to the service. (booked on booking)

__label__pos hotel not very expensive for this area. Friendly welcome and comfortable bedding.

__label__pos overpriced, very noisy, and hygiene is more than basic. in a word, lamentable. I had planned to stay 4 nights, I left just after the first. to avoid, even in Paris we find better for much cheaper. expensive , very noisy , and not clean at all . in a word pathetic . i was supposed to stay there for 4 nights , but i left right away after the first one . avoid it , you 'll easily find better and cheaper , even in paris .

__label__pos a sublime hotel not far from the marsh whose design was realized by fashion designer stella cadente. a magical and enchanting universe full of originality and ingenuity! we are in the middle of a fairy tale and have been rehearsing for only 2 nights. I highly recommend .

__label__pos nice family hotel. there is a nice complicity with the hotel staff (smiling, friendly, pleasant). as it is next to the place de la Bastille, the price is a little high but it is still suitable. the downside for non-party people is that the hallways are narrow and that at night there is some noise due to nearby cafes ... ..

__label__pos a very good hotel with friendly staff and very well kept rooms. located in the heart of the district of the bastille, at a price of the most attractive, it is the hotel of choice for people who wish to enjoy bastille / marsh districts without worrying about the last subways.

__label__pos Do not go there ... expensive and dirty hotel, horrible and smelly area, far below the usual standards for this kind of establishment and rates. only the bedding is to keep. I have been there regularly for 3 years for professional reasons of proximity, today I prefer to go further and make transport time to avoid this hotel that I saw literally decay with time as well as the quarter that some days is like a field of rubbish, mixed with vomit and urine. during my last stay amp; heats of early July, 18h a paunchy man was washing, naked but slip, just sitting in the gutter just in front of having jumped the water inlet city of Paris ... others were waiting their turn sitting on the sidewalk ... great view from my room whose main curtain was also broken ...

__label__pos we had a very pleasant stay at the studio galabelle. spacious studio (we could accommodate a bed umbrella without worries), very comfortable, quiet overlooking the garden. we enjoyed putting ourselves there at night after visiting the capital. metro and shops very close. Very good value for money .

__label__pos welcoming staff and reasonable comfort. but there is a big problem! all rooms overlook the avenue and the noise is almost permanent, at an intolerable level for normally formed ears. do not we know how to isolate the windows I had to buy earplugs and I slept little, it is crippling for me

__label__pos I stayed 6 days at this hotel, we were well acceuili. the hotel is very well located the nearest metro and about 5 minutes. there is a fickle to make tea and coffee they fill every morning. by story you hear when people talk or go back to their room. Anyway, I recommend this hotel.

__label__pos if quot; charm quot; means small and unhealthy so yes this hotel is a real charming hotel where stars seem to be proportional to the disappointments. poorly insulated rooms (no double glazing - attention to noisy neighbors or other techno at 5am), staff unpleasant (the matron of breakfast is a zolaque character alone!) , bathroom with a thousand leaks or other pipe noise, elevator worthy of a Cantonese mine musty smell and more, benefits far below what we would expect from a hotel with three stars. go next time ibis direction or equivalent, fed up of shabby places of sleep merchants who will end a day, for lack of customers, to recycle their rabbit cages in real breeding places ...

__label__pos I go there frequently and I appreciate enormously the jovial welcome of the team. it's nice to see smiles and good mood, especially in Paris! night guards, maids and hostesses make you feel at home. the hotel is very well located, close to the subway in the rue du commerce. you have the possibility for professionals to use pro format invoices. the only downside is the local small, but hey it's paris! we must not ask the impossible.
