very nice hotel, the price is seen in the quality of the service and the place. ideally located in the center, the street does not look mine but the interior is very nice. if you are passing through paris and want to relax in a chic and well located, this hotel is for you!
No sound insulation between rooms, it is a shame to pay 230 euros and not to sleep ... minimalist rooms and finishes that leave something to be desired (a bulb hs. hanging wires). the TV is of a mediocre quality ... we get to sleep better in a formula 1 ...
The hotel is a classic chain, but the neighborhood is very friendly and lively, multicultural. the hotel is therefore very well placed
simple and affordable, clean and quiet the wifi and more.
this hotel is advertised as three stars far from offering services on this level the rooms are extremely small and inconsistent with the photos, the bathroom far from resembling a bathroom of a three star hotel with not even the usual products such as shower gel and shampoo which are still a minimum and when at breakfast it is a strict minimum. the fact that it is included in the price of the room does not imply that it must be the strict minimum with just a mini chocolate bread, croissant and apple slipper lost in a pantry. If I had to give a score of 0 to 10 to this hotel, I will give it 4. and I will strongly cancel it to my friends.
nice hotel, reasonable price, good reception, lunch ok
just quot; the carillon quot; what)
value for money interesting!
comfortable hotel. well located for those who like to discover paris on foot. nice home. parking (fee) and metro nearby. the rooms are simple but the beds comfortable. the neighborhood is calm. the Boulevard boulevard is full of restaurants of all styles, the large rex is a few hundred meters. i discovered this hotel in 2006 thanks to the quot; backpacker's guide quot; I went back this year, I was going to a show at Bercy ... which is only 15 minutes by subway.
very nice home, very good value for money
hotel very good, quality of rooms and hospitality perfect) the service is very attentive and quality. this hotel is in the line of the best western brand. to advise the price is quite high but the service is good ....
very nice room, modern, close to 3 subway lines. To advice
impeccable situation in the heart of paris in front of a vélib station and subway, everything is the welcome, cleanliness, charm of the marsh a hotel in Paris (without the noise) with the magic of a Parisian interior. thank you for the stay
I did not stay in the hotel but the small bar in the hotel is exceptional. the cocktails are really good and the waiters very friendly. the place is looking for calm, so ideal to have a drink for two after a dinner in the neighborhood.
a small hotel with charm very discreet but exceptional. amazing architectural proposal around a courtyard that offers calm. the cozy bar offers trendy cocktails. to follow the events throughout the year photo exhibitions, private parties, Christmas market or very private screenings. the little extra it is not necessary to rent a room to make a visit to this little haven.
a place that is starting to be fashionable. in a surprising area, you can not imagine 1) a small square and 2) such a place, hotel and restaurant at this place. but already, arriving, we realize that we are not the only ones ... and the servers are totally overwhelmed. wine side, the selection is interesting even if limited enough eventually. flat side, we do not understand quickly how it works. we are told things to share, and then finally no, and finally yes. in any case, fried squid are delicious and crispy. very good scallops and pork too. a good address but no doubt it will be necessary to allow time for the first visitors to get tired to find a little peace in this place
how not to rush to edgar when the sun comes up. their terrace is just magic. in addition the dishes are very good. at noon or in the evening, this place is very pleasant. only detail, pre-do a little in advance because you will not be alone on the spot.
a very nice place, with its beautiful terrace overlooking a small square. the dining room is very well decorated, in blue and gold, which offers a warm atmosphere instead. On the other hand, I thought the food was expensive! some dishes are to share and yet they are not necessarily easy dishes to share. the food is ok but nothing more, some dishes are good, others very disappointing ... the service is impeccable and very effective! I am so disappointed with the cuisine and the price. I would stay again so maybe just for a drink!
I agree with the comments below! this hotel is shocking, disgusting and very very expensive! Spend your money on people who want to work well! i agree with the comments below . this hotel is disgusting and very expensive . i would recommend to spend your money somewhere else . those people do n't like doing their job well !
charming home. the suite was beautiful and what a beautiful bathtub! to try in love. everything is new and beautiful.
correct home. However, we have recovered a room overlooking the street whose soundproofing proved to be very insufficient, especially on Saturday evening where I had the impression to find myself a good part of the night to the circles of the party-goers who meet on the small square at 100m with music and cries of jubilant loudly.
hotel rather nice despite room service a bit slow. otherwise the restaurant is fine without more and the price of the room is ok to spend the night. the shower is great in the room. and the beds are comfortable
Better pay more than risk coming to this hotel. blanket, room not cleaned (a handkerchief under the bed), the sheets seem changed and the trash emptied, but it is the bare minimum. a teenager would do better his room. yes it's cheap in one sense, but it's theft in another, because they do not even the bare minimum in terms of hygiene.
hello we had the privilege to be the first to sign the guestbook of the hotel o)) we had a great stay in this hotel located close to the place of the republic (well, we it was still under construction last December!) . the rooms are modern, the staff is very caring and hamam very nice after a day of walking ... we recommend this hotel and it is on we will return ...
very good welcome in the hotel, nice breakfast at 5.50 €, you can leave your luggage arriving until time of departure without additional costs. the staff is friendly, moreover it is open 24/24 the hotel is easily accessible by metro and all near the major stations. it is not the luxury but very correct for the price. I keep the address for my next trips to Paris
family hotel very correct price level
I highly recommend this hotel, good location, best value on paris, impossible to find better, warm welcome, free wifi and unlimited, the rooms are clean, open 24/7. in short, only happiness! ah, I forgot, very important, except the month of August, it is advisable to book 2 or even 3 months in advance. reservation very simple to make (no cb or tralala ...), you just give your name and then you just have to wait for the date and volià! in passing a little cuckoo raymonde, momone, bernie, poupoul, jacques and jack! see you soon ! !
hotel quiet and well kept but there is a black dot breakfast is to say the least old ... we could hope for this price something a little more consistent! ...
Hotel dilapidated, particularly noisy with a staff little involved a-me-foutiste ... mattress in bowl, remote control hs, breakfast avave in the basement and minimalist. services quot; offered quot; displayed in room not held ... in short if you can choose another address do not hesitate! !
room infested with bed flea or other bedbug.
very nice charming hotel with impeccable cleanliness.a bird's nest for lovers.personnel attentive and helpful.
it will be perfect when the breakfast room is over
very well placed in the heart of chatelet; nice rooms well decorated and excellent service
excellent! everything is more than perfect! we come back!
the ice betting operation at City Hall is great for people who can not go on vacation. by installing on the forecourt an outdoor rink for adults and small is great. it is the happiness of all lovers of skiing more than the access to ice rinks is free and skate rental is 5 € v really to do
just delicious, one thing is certain every euro spent is more than justified. pleasant setting, pampering service, and just perfect kitchen not to be missed.
cute, colorful and welcoming address a few meters from bastille. the rooms are cozy and warm. side restaurant very nice surprises in the plate. especially at the brunch hour on saturday and sunday with proposals for tapas to fall steeply. the little bright restaurant room.
warm welcome, very cute decor, easy access ... the rooms are a little small, but the layout is clever and charm.
my most beautiful memory of paris ... so much
nice servers. Milkshakes delicious and cold! and a superb view of Notre Dame de Paris ... ideal to land.
one of the most beautiful mansion of paris. built between 1625 and 1630 by jean androuet of the hoop. bought in 1634 by the duke of sully. very good bookstore specialized on the capital. garden giving access to the Vosges after a short break on a bench.
nice visits to see again. visit with the association of paris in 4 (75004). go there preferably on Saturday morning around 10am which allows you to have lunch in the neighborhood after visiting the garden. and if it's nice to sit on a bench.
hotel full of charm, we especially appreciate the calm in the patio ideal for breakfast or a drink. Nice and clean room, and very welcoming and friendly staff.
great location, very welcome, clean. ideal to discover Paris.
Cheap, well located, but disappointing comfort and service compared to what is presented on the very (very) beautiful website. just opposite excellent Korean restaurant!
small teasing "inside, the traveler gets to know the rooms. for example, the "Crystal Queen" is a room thought like a fairy cave, studded with Swarovski crystals. the "enchanted forest" is a room marked by the universe of shadow theater of childhood, a magical place populated by imaginary animals, trees, leaves ... "a real dreamlike and unusual place in paris.
I hope this new url, quite simple, will be useful to all our hosts and our friends!
excellent Berber cuisine at very good prices.
perfect hotel! if you are looking for a budget place to sleep and do a little toilet, this hotel is perfect. clean, well located and very welcome.
I spent 4 days here on a business trip, and I recommend this one. Comfortable and clean room, all the staff are very friendly, I will definitely stay here again.
Establishment with elegant simplicity, the montana restaurant offers every Sunday a brunch of quality, and this from 11:00 to 14:30. Turning to the French tradition, you can eventually enjoy brunch, accompanied by quality cheese, including fresh cheese with red berries, followed by its exquisite Corsican cured meats.
the hotel tamaris is an excellent hotel quality price for paris. pleasant stay.
I had the opportunity to spend two nights in this hotel for a business trip and I must say that I was perfectly satisfied. Firstly worried about the reviews on booking, I must say that I for my part had an excellent stay the rooms are spacious (Parisian hotel), the staff friendly and helpful, the hotel very beautiful and design. the breakfast was excellent (a lot of variety, nice room, quality products) and I must say that I was expecting more than 13 euros for a 4 star hotel in Paris! I usually stay at Best Western hotels, so I recommend this one at 100. moreover it is well located 4 minutes from the metro bel air on the 6th and close to the line 1, and a lot of commerce / restaurant nearby.
I recommend ! hotel completely renovated in a quiet area, rare in Paris. in addition to their launch, they make promotional rates ...
value for money very interesting, very close to the metro and very nice room, ideal for small budgets!
I chose this hotel because I was going to see a game in Rolland Garros. located in the xvie near the metro, and 10 minutes walk from the courses of rg. a small hotel with a beautiful decoration of exposed beams and shimmering fabrics. impeccable bedding. small shower room but pretty! the 54 overlooks the inner garden. nice quality of breakfast not too expensive, and more.
good location in relation to the exhibition park of the porte de versailes, eiffel tower and very well connected bus, metro taxi. Excellent value . nice staff.
very clean and spacious premises, calm building
friendly, family-run hotel with staff ready to offer help spontaneously.
ideal location to discover Paris and its neighborhood life (small market, restaurants, bars, ...) superb home, nice rooms with beautiful views of the Eiffel Tower and very good value for money ...
excellent welcome. staff available. hearty breakfast. Very affordable rates for a hotel in the square.
