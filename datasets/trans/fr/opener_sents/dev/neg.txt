this hotel is a horror. the decoration is old and scary, limit glaucous; the smell of fresh air and humidity is poor and takes us by the throat when we arrive in the lobby. the room is worse when the door is opened, a smell more than unpleasant, as if the room had welcomed a band of drunk people who have not washed in days. the household supposedly done, but walking on the floor, you feel a sticky substance like dried soda. a television that works every other time, dust that is not made on parts of the room. the ceiling is damaged by moisture and is gradually peeling off. the beds and the desk are so old that it's unbearable. the bathroom is worse stains in the tub, hair on the inside, the bidet is disgusting, some of the tiles have come off the wall, giving us a view of the pipes. the room is very poorly soundproofed, you can hear everything outside the room the sounds of footsteps, shouting, and even the vibrators of the phone. I strongly advise you to avoid this hotel. the price is very attractive but there is nothing else positive. apart from the district well served and pleasant.
poorly soundproofed, poorly cleaned, poor quality broken lamps, shower curtains not holding, and small beds moderately comfortable. in a gloomy summary.
a very nice hotel, recently renovated. design and refined decoration, very good taste. the staff, with the exception of the director of the establishment and her assistant was a little cold with us, limiting ourselves to polite phrases and without any smile. we had a very good night, the rooms are well soundproofed and the bedding quality. Affordable rates for a 4-star hotel in Paris, two metro stops from the Gare de Lyon (line 1, Porte de Vincennes station).
Although well located, I was very disappointed by the quality of service of this establishment which is not for me not up to a three star hotel. the staff made mistakes and was unable to recognize and manage them. Also, my room was not very clean, poorly maintained (plug and phone defective) and poorly insulated I felt like someone was washing in my bathroom ... and one day at the front door left to pass the light of the corridor in the room. not to mention the metro that we hear and feel pass. a bad quality / price ratio, to avoid!
excellent establishment. deserves its 3 stars. very well located in relation to the Eiffel Tower, the Montparnasse Tower and the Latin Quarter.
a deplorable and shameful customer service. we are used to traveling regularly and we have never seen that we got robbed our room, we complained but no one believed us! even though we are loyal customers we have run into walls and bad faith! in short, a hotier to flee
the shame of the French hotel business. uncomfortable bed, tiny bathroom with broken shower door and cracked mirror. Air conditioning sending a huge cloud of dust into the room. Unbearable cooking odors ... Anyway, if I could put 0 or even -1 it would have been even more accurate.
I booked this hotel because I had to pass oral exams and my usual hotel was full. I was extremely disappointed, I found myself in a very small room, dark and without double glazing (very strange in a city like Paris). the ceiling height was very low, especially in the bathroom, being tall is quite embarrassing! also, there was no shower head in the shower ... to have access to the internet you had to pay 5 euros per day (hum) while in the hotel that I usually go it's free. I seriously wonder how this hotel can have 3 stars ... I cut short my stay and found another hotel, a real 3 star, much cheaper with a more spacious room! I find it shameful to offer such a mediocrity of service and quality. I will never go back!
ideal location, located less than ten minutes walk from the montparnasse station, and between lines 4 and 6 for the metro, ideal for visiting paris. the hotel is very quiet and the rooms are well soundproofed. the staff (mostly female) are friendly and welcoming (the maids are lovely). Negative air conditioning in the room, it was much too hot, we had to open the window to refresh! and the price of breakfast (15 euros) is excessive.
the worst hotel of my life, even at Disney it was better ... first thing I do not like when arriving, the receptionist tries to make me sign a discharge saying that I allowed the hotel to take on my card all fresh even if my signature was not at the bottom of the bill ... I do not like being taken for a thief especially that it is rather me who have the impression of having been made ... I explain 165 euros the room and about thirty for the 2 lunches (on which I would return ...), that was the service in return arrived in a room with decoration more than improbable, the tapestry was at least being 30 years old and changing from one wall to another, all in a bad taste of the most certain, frankly even the house of my grandmother is more classy and above all it is cleaner, the walls were covered with traces, a few torn in some places, the switches were not the same, there was only one only taken! pegs in the walls ... ... I rush like any traveler arriving on the bathroom and toilet, first disappointment the shower seals are brown / black, the bathtub seems to have been rinsed but no more, the wc flee, in short it starts badly ... my little sister when she rushes on the wifi, and it's the drama, the wifi is 5 € / h or 10 € day ... wtf seriously you have not shame to charge for what is free in other cheaper hotel so I go out of the hotel to enjoy the Parisian life, I come back quite late, let's go to the fact that the guard is in front of the tv rather than the home, then sleep until waking up to the sweet sound of the subway and vibrations while we were on the 3rd floor ... life is well done anyway if I was asleep I would have missed the quot; fabulous quot; (cough) lunch, for loan of 30 euro you have the right to a yoghurt, 1 mini chocolate bread, a mini croissant and a crouton per person, you will need quot; share quot; 3 small portions of jam, an apple and a mandarin, quot; share quot; because there will be only one of each for 2 (the order has been correctly completed). Finally, I did not notice the presence of a fire safety system in the room, if the hotel had been good I would have said they had to be elegantly camouflaged, but saw the stew of the hotel I would say they were absent (but I must surely deceive myself ... / whistle ...) this review is a first throw, I forget I'm sure but I would come to complete it ... so as not to pass for someone doing the advertised for another hotel, i would just say that 2 other people from my group were in another hotel quot; a chain quot; , cheaper, and we regretted not having chosen the same, much better, own bigger (even with a mini garden) and also close ... in short, flee edouard vi he has class that his name ! ps photos are coming! and still i have little exploitable because they are fuzzy as the hotel ^^
the reception is not friendly if we can call it home ... no hot water for the shower, we had quot; forgot quot; to warn us on arrival that the boiler was down and no excuse. luckily the room is pretty tidy but it will not be enough to make me return to a future stay
to recommend to all active, reserve and retired staff. unbeatable value for money.
a very quiet inner course, you will see ... thank you for telling us that there was work beginning at dawn! Without double glazing, it's like they're in the room! free wifi access please also specify that the network is not secure and that the whole neighborhood also has access. the result is so much that it is impossible to connect to it. the rooms are small, the bathroom shabby and the household done in haste (I do not want to know what are these yellowish and sticky spots on the wall of the bathroom ...) a horror not to advise !
